83,83,Episode 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxhrPdZdog,01:58 ,118,0, How does the fed raising interest rates fights off inflation?," How does the fed raising interest rates fights off inflation? OK. OK. OK. Can you please explain how the Fed raising interest rates fights off inflation? I understand it can slow down the housing and car market. But how does it impact other goods? Bikes, dishwashers, clothes, et cetera. Especially when there are supply side issues. Would the Fed be raising rates if demand and supply were at equilibrium? This is true that the Fed can't produce more. Some of the conductors, they can't build more houses. They can't put more cars in the lots. Here's one of the things they can do. They can make money more expensive. So maybe people don't buy a second home because instead of 3% it's 5%, I'm not going to pay for another house here. I'm not going to buy a vacation home. Maybe some companies cut back on investments because the hurdle rate is not much higher. I think it's also psychological component to this. People see asset prices falling and they might cut back on spending. He'll Dudley who's a former New York Fed chair, wrote yesterday in Bloomberg. In contrast to many other countries, the US economy doesn't respond directly to the level of short-term interest rates. The home borrowers aren't affected because they have long-term fixed rate mortgages. Again, in contrast to many other countries, US households do hold a significant amount of wealth and equities. As a result, their sensitive financial conditions, equity price influence how wealthy people feel and how willing they are to spend rather than save. He's saying the Fed has to jack up rates to lower the stock market. That makes sense. I don't know what the unintended consequences are going to be. Is a recession going to be better than high inflation? I think we might get a chance to find out if the Fed has their way. The Fed can't make supply chain issues go better, get back without helping demand. A lot of pressure. All right. Up to the next one. Shyclot. That was pretty close. All right. Next one. The best thing about the Fed, too, is you can always blame the Fed, right? If things don't go your way. Of course. That's why I like about it. I'm sorry. Okay. So what particular sectors or names come to mind for young investors with a 35 to 40-year time horizon? All right. Easy. I don't know. I have no idea. You could say technology. That'd be an easy one. But there was this book I read my brother got for me for Christmas one year in 2007. The Forever portfolio by James Altichur, while people. He picked these stocks that you could hold forever for decades and decades. Most of the stocks you've never heard of today because things changed. It was right before the Great Recession. Then you had all this other stuff happen afterwards. All the stocks that I ended up doing well, you wouldn't have picked. So even picking out a decade and a half later is harder than three to four decades. John throw up this chart of the biggest stocks in the S&P going back to 1980. You can see here in 1980, it was basically all energy stocks. These stocks have turned over so many times. It's so hard to pick. So maybe if you want to say like tech technology is going to be a big part of the lives. Maybe the Nasdaq 100. But if you have three to four decades ahead of you, guess what? The easiest thing to do is you bet on the market. Corporations will continue to produce profits. They'll continue to innovate. That's what you want to do. I'm trying to pick certain stocks or sectors for three to four decades in the future when the future is so uncertain. It's really difficult and basically impossible to do. Perfect timing. Look at that. I actually had to follow up on that one real fast. What percentage of companies do you think will no longer even be around in 40 years? A very high percentage. Yeah, that's what I was, yeah, it seems like a lot. Yes. Through bankruptcy, your mergers and acquisitions or whatever, yes. Picking those companies is, is ridiculous. It's that long. It's hard to do it for next year, next five years, ten years, 30 to 40 years in the future is really difficult. Okay. So next we have what will bring more value in the long run for a child, paying for a fancy private college that totals $250,000 or sending them to a mid-tier public school on a full ride and putting that $250,000 into an index fund for their retirement? Listen, this is the type of question that is way easier to answer as an older person than a younger person. Like, when you're older, you can easily say, like, don't spend a lot of money on a wedding because that's a waste of money, right? Or why would you spend all this money on college when you can just invest it and start a business and go bet on yourself? Like, that's way easier to say as a younger person. Like, hey, outside of the top 15 to 20 schools, it doesn't matter where your degree came from, as long as you get one, right? But I think you use this as a teaching moment, right? So you can say option one, you go to a really expensive school, but you forego this potential will financially be set up as a young person and maybe buying your first house or paying for a wedding or whatever you want to do with the money retiring early. Or you go to a state school, but here's what you're giving up. You're not going to go to a nice expensive school that you want to. You could be missing out on experiences and which one did you regret more? You put all the information out there for me. You just as a teaching opportunity, maybe talk about compound interest a little bit before their eyes glaze over. But I say if you're going to do this, don't scold someone, don't force them, give them all the information and let them make the decisions themselves, right? Because again, your decision at A to 18, maybe they say, you know what? I'll make my own money someday. I don't need your money. I want to go to this school because my friends are going there because that is an awesome program that I want to do. Whatever. You do you help them make an adult decision and let them figure out which path is better for them? Yeah, now that sounds like good advice. Also, yeah, so much of college is about what you make it. Like, they're brilliant people who go to, you know, like less prestigious schools and end up, you know, being very successful. Well, my favorite one is private school doesn't really need that much. Oh, did we lose you been? Oh, I think we might have lost, lost been there for a second. All right. Well, let's give them a second to see if he comes back. And if he doesn't, then maybe I'll bring Matt back in. All right. So, we'll switch this up a little bit. So we'll go ahead and jump into Matt. So Matt, get ready. I'm going to get your opinion on this. What do you think about this question between the public mid-tier school and a private school? Also, I should introduce you. This is a Matt Warius, young advisor extraordinaire at Reholtz Wealth. We're going to surprise you at question 8. Sure. I'll go ahead and bring you in. Of course, don't we curve ball right off the bat here. Love it. So I agree with Bennett. It's much easier to answer this as an older person just saying, having gone through the experience of paying for these types of big events and saying, well, did I really need that? But the experiences are worth something. So, in terms of where are you going to go to school, as long as you get to go to education, I think, and even if it's a mid-tier school, if you're not paying as much money, you'll probably end up OK at the end of the day. You'll end up all right. So, I mean, don't kill yourself over. Don't feel like you have to spend godly amounts of money on school, but also at the same time, you want the experience, right? You want to be able to learn the things that don't necessarily happen in college. Meeting people and networking, all that type of stuff is important. And when we're older, it's easier to say, did I really need that? Right. Yeah, hindsight, if people aren't happy with their careers, they're always going to work back and be like, oh, I spent too much on college. But I think that some of that is hindsight bias. Also, we both went to school very close to each other. You went to coastal Carolina. On the coast of South Carolina, I went to UNCW on the coast of North Carolina. So, yeah, I had a great experience. OK, so this is uncharted territory. Then it's still not back. So, he must be having some serious computer difficulties. So, yeah, we're taking over. And, yeah, I guess we'll just continue on. So, John, John hit it. Let's go to the next question. OK. So, did we get binned back? Hold on. Let's see. Ben, thank God. I'm on my phone. The power literally just went out of my business. And I was like, how long do I give it before we just completely regroup and continue on? But this is great. It's not like we're alive or anything. Yeah, we're only, this is the power. My, the power in my whole office just literally shut down. And I'm sitting here in darkness, but I'm on my phone. So, I apologize for the video, but. No, hey, it works. It works. Where were we? So, we were wrapping up the college question. So, we're out of the next one. Matt had some good contributions there. Matt, you can hop in and help out. Yeah, yeah. So, we'll just have Matt on. I guess not too. The surprise is over. OK. Robnex, long time viewer of the show, love all the content you put out. I'm 23 and just graduated from college. I landed my first job at a financial services firm and I'm wondering how I should allocate my earnings. Would you recommend focusing on paying off my student loans first around $30,000 or building up my retirement portfolio? My boring answer to this one is I like the idea of splitting it up because I think that's the simplest way to go about it. And I think building those financial habits early and saving is important. Now, it could be one of these people that just loves paying off debt because you hate it so much. Duncan, I can't remember. You a Duke or North Carolina fan because you're from North Carolina. I'm a Duke fan. OK. So, some people hate debt as much as people outside of Durham, North Carolina, hate coach K and Duke, right? Oh, wow. Yeah. What comes from the triolic? It's pretty good to go. Come on. There's something new. But I'm just saying, if you really want to these people that just hate debt and cannot stand it and it's going to keep you up at night, paid off, I like the idea of splitting it up and building those savings habits while you pay off the debt. And then when the debts paid off, roll that those payments into your savings. For sure. I agree. I mean, you guys start contributing to the 401K, at least. I think a little bit. You don't have to do a lot, but you can do both at the same time. There's no reason why not. Yes, at least get your match. All right. Was it? So, right on time. There we go. So, one thing I had to add to that is just, yeah, the Dave Ramsey School of like no debt ever kind of thing. That always, to me, is kind of annoying because it's like, well, you're basically telling a lot of people that they can't like go to college then if they can't take out student loan debt because you should never take out. Yeah, I feel like you're saying some people are so, so extreme about it. It's kind of off. Yeah, that's a debt that's going to pay off for you. There's good and bad debt. Right. For sure. Okay. So, up next, we have my friend, who's 38 years old, has a 2.8% 30 year fixed mortgage, roughly 24 years left, and pays an extra $400 each month towards her principal. If she continues to prepay $400 towards her principal, she has about 16 years remaining. Her house has enjoyed strong appreciation in the past six years, about 85% according to Zilla. I told her I would show, I told her that I would slow pay the mortgage due to the phenomenal rate plus significant appreciation and invest the $400 a month in the stock market. What are your thoughts on this? I do think the rates matter in these things. I got my first interest rate I paid at my house like 6.5%. And we ended up refinancing a few times to the point where we kept making the same payment and it was like double by the end. But then only sold her house after 10 years, I realized like, wait, what was that money doing for me? It was illicit, it was just sitting there. It wasn't that great. I think if you have that low of a payment and it's taxed advantage, I think you have to think about that in terms of like, how are the rest of your finances? Are you on track with your retirement savings? Could you be using this money for something better than a 2.8% repayment on your house? Yeah, it's mad. Some people just don't like debt. So I mean, if that's how you are, you know, and it's that's keeping you up at night, then pay it off. Yeah, otherwise there's probably other things you could be doing with it. And that's just, you know, takes a little bit more deeper dive into your full picture. It's a really, really low hurdle rate. Yeah. Cool. We didn't even get to the buzzer on that one. So let's keep trucking along. Okay. So another fed one. What happens when the fed raises rates? Moreover, if the bond market has priced in several rate hikes, why raise rates 25 basis points per month? If 6.25 basis point hikes are priced in this year, what would happen if the fed raised to 1% in March? I don't really understand this one. I have to be honest. Okay. So they're basically saying the fed has this target that they want interest rates to get to, but they're taking their time and it's going to take them a while to get there. And if they're going to get to 2% or 3% anyway, why not just rip that band it off and do it now? So they're taking a stair step function where they're doing like little income instead of time. This is the hardest price, the hardest part of investing is like what's priced into the market? No one really knows because there are no counterfactuals. And I think the idea is like if they ripped the band it off and did this, what would they be signaling? Like, things are worse than people think. There'd be like a meltdown, some countertuitive reaction. Like maybe the bond market would be worse than the stock market in this case. I think it's mostly psychological because people can't handle big, huge changes right away. Throwing the kitchen stick, I think people would just freak out because it's so much of a psychological. Yeah, I can't believe I'm doing this for my phone. Yeah, I know. It's surreal. 45 seconds left on the timer. You have anything else? Yeah. Let's just do the next one. I know we can spend some time in that question. Okay. Hey, so up next, I'm 44 and single with no kids. I have a net worth of around $425,000. College educated and financial controller at a commercial real estate firm in Chicago. I would have more if Twitter had performed better though I didn't sell any. I, or I haven't sold any. I own 55, 5,550 shares at $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am? Okay. So this one was obviously sent to us before Elon Musk decided to happen and buy 9% of Twitter and shares shut up third percent this year. So now this guy's up like 65% on his shares. John throw the chart up of Twitter. This is Twitter since the IPO has not done great. The S&P is up like 200% since Twitter run public. Twitter is up like 15%. That includes this week's run up in prices from Elon Musk taking over. I think it's funny. This guy included Twitter in his asking how he's doing. But because I think if you're a whole financial ecosystem is based around how one stock is doing and it has to make or break you, that's kind of tough. The other thing is you have them in Monwany. The idea of answering where am I? I think that's hard to do because you have to answer where do I want to be, how much you want to spend, when do I want to retire, what are my goals. So Matt, someone comes to you and says, here's how much money I have, here's my age, here's where I want to be. How do you help them understand whether you're on the right track or not? Yeah. Every situation is different. So we really have to take a look at everything that's going on and see where do you want to be. How do you envision the rest of your life playing out and what resources do you currently have to get there and what capabilities do you have to continue to add to these goals and what's prioritized them? So I did a back of the envelope for this one. If this guy did nothing else, that $425,000 or whatever he has, here in 6% of his money, he returns to 65. He's got like $1.3 or $1.4 million. If since he's a listener of the show, he's maxing out his 401k, he's maxing out his Rolf IRA. So that's $26,000 a year call it. If he did that in addition to what he already has, he'd have like $2.3 million. So I think you take that and you say, I don't know what the market is actually going to do, but if I need more than that, I'm going to work longer. I'm going to save more. If I need less than that, maybe it can save less now or retire a little earlier. So I think that's how you look at those goal posts long away. I cheated. I just did that when we finished. I think that was all our lightener on. We did pretty good. We got through seven of them and we helped two questions from Matt. We're going to bring Matt in now before I had my technical piece. Back to the pandemic. Back to the pandemic. There's a storm here today. So yeah, my power went out. But let's do a couple more. We got one floor that we've got from Matt here. And by the way, a lot of these questions, I think are from younger viewers, which I think is great. And a lot of these. So we want to bring Matt in since he specializes working with some younger investors. So let's ask a question here. Okay. So what are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor? Especially as a young person. All right. Really great question. Because I think this is one of the hardest things for people to understand. Like, I don't know because you go to the hospital and they give you a doctor. You don't like to select them. A lot of things. You don't really know what you're looking for. So Matt, why don't you talk about when you're talking to prospective clients? What are the things they should be looking for? And what are some of the red flags that maybe they shouldn't be asking questions about? Yeah, definitely. It's a great question. I think anyone looking for an advisor, you have to be seeking out a long-term relationship. You want something that's going to last. You don't want to hop around a bunch, go from advisor to advisor. So you really want to take it seriously. You want to do your due diligence and you want to ask the right questions. There are wrong questions to ask as well. So right questions being obviously the obvious ones. Are you a fiduciary? Are you going to serve my best interests at all times? If you're a younger investor, I think a key question is, how do I fit into your firm's philosophy, given where I am in life right now? And how is that path going to evolve for me as a client of the firm? And what you're like, as a young person, you could have certain things that are going on in your life and you have life events that change. So it's like, how can you help me along the way as I have these changes happen? Right. So what are the services that I should be seeking out right now that you can provide to me? How will that change? And then what are the fees around those services? Do the fees change? Right. Obviously, you don't want to be paying a ton of money for stuff you don't need. So you want to be cognizant of that as well, I think. So you know, and then we can get into like investment philosophy. If you're someone who is a little bit more experienced when it comes to investing, you've done some on your own, right? Obviously, you want to make the relationship as easy as possible to be able to stick with it for a long time. So you want to make sure philosophy is aligned, I think. Yeah. I also think one of the most important things is like, what does a relationship look like going forward? Like, how are you going to work with me? How often are we going to talk and communicate? Because I know that can vary for our clients. Some people want to have their hand held and talk all the time. Some people want check-ins, you know, irregularly. So it kind of depends like, how are you going to work with me and how are you going to fit with my schedule and personality? Yeah, I think the key is expectations have to be aligned in the beginning. So spend time with whoever you're talking to, talk to more than one firm, and really make sure that you're getting, you're setting out on the right foot in terms of what the expectations are. For both, the advisor and the client. And both should desire the same thing in terms of having a long-term relationship that's beneficial to most importantly the client. Right. A lot of it comes down to, here's what I want out of you. Can you actually fill what I want? Or are you just telling me what I want to hear? I agree. Yeah, definitely. Do you ever get any like personal questions like your favorite music or sports or stuff like that? I mean, because it seems like people would naturally want to know that stuff if they're going to have a long-term relationship. Definitely. That's the fun part is getting to know people and really getting to mesh with certain people and see, hey, do we even get along? Sometimes you don't get along with somebody. Has nothing to do with finance or numbers or your financial plans and it's like, all right, we just get along and I trust this person. I think trust is a huge thing. Obviously, it seems obvious, but you want to trust whoever you're seeking out as an advisor. So that a lot of times you want to work with someone that you like and respect and trust I think is the big aunt for sure. Yeah, I would need to ask favorite Beatles album. Sorry, I just put them in the chat. No, I'm just kidding. By the way, I think that Dunkin' Worst podcast question ever. Beatles or Stones, right? Oh, because of the obviousness of it, it's like it's not even a contest. Well, it's also like, yes, it's, yes, okay. I'll see the next one. I probably just made a bunch of people mad. Okay. So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because this is a huge, we're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know, six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying. Yeah, like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity cost, right? What are the goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into equity in your home could be used for? Right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want a front load of five to nine plan and you some of this money for that. So that's just one example, but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, hey, I saved up the money. Should I just throw it on to my house? I also think interest. Especially when you're young, borrowing money makes more sense to me because especially with the house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if you realize a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually, right? You still have that cash somewhere. So I think that, that is the kind of thing where it's, it's hard to take that one back if you buy the house and all cash. Obviously, maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding, we're having all cash could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you lose some flexibility by just having it paid off. Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is pretty big, I think. I mean, a couple months ago, you know, it's, it's, like you said, it's more obvious, but still, even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other parts of your life, having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, is, it could be restraining a little bit. But again, you got these people, they just hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know, the conversation's going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation if it's required for the person that we're dealing with. Duncan, I'm not going to make a coach K Duke reference here because I know it's, it's a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize. It's rough. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's been rough. It's a tough way for them to go out. But literally the worst team they could have lost to, you know, everyone knows I guess. Yeah, they had to be tough. All right. Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years now almost and I've never lost power before. So, yeah, glad I could be the one on here today to experience another time. I think Matt was stepping in. We got to mention no portfolio rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami recording a live additional mental spirits that if we figured out, I can hopefully go up on this channel at some point.

84,84,Episode 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxhrPdZdog,03:30 ,210,0, What particular sectors/names do you find most compelling for a young investor with a 35 40 year time horizon?," What particular sectors/names do you find most compelling for a young investor with a 35 40 year time horizon? Shyclot. That was pretty close. All right. Next one. The best thing about the Fed, too, is you can always blame the Fed, right? If things don't go your way. Of course. That's why I like about it. I'm sorry. Okay. So what particular sectors or names come to mind for young investors with a 35 to 40-year time horizon? All right. Easy. I don't know. I have no idea. You could say technology. That'd be an easy one. But there was this book I read my brother got for me for Christmas one year in 2007. The Forever portfolio by James Altichur, while people. He picked these stocks that you could hold forever for decades and decades. Most of the stocks you've never heard of today because things changed. It was right before the Great Recession. Then you had all this other stuff happen afterwards. All the stocks that I ended up doing well, you wouldn't have picked. So even picking out a decade and a half later is harder than three to four decades. John throw up this chart of the biggest stocks in the S&P going back to 1980. You can see here in 1980, it was basically all energy stocks. These stocks have turned over so many times. It's so hard to pick. So maybe if you want to say like tech technology is going to be a big part of the lives. Maybe the Nasdaq 100. But if you have three to four decades ahead of you, guess what? The easiest thing to do is you bet on the market. Corporations will continue to produce profits. They'll continue to innovate. That's what you want to do. I'm trying to pick certain stocks or sectors for three to four decades in the future when the future is so uncertain. It's really difficult and basically impossible to do. Perfect timing. Look at that. I actually had to follow up on that one real fast. What percentage of companies do you think will no longer even be around in 40 years? A very high percentage. Yeah, that's what I was, yeah, it seems like a lot. Yes. Through bankruptcy, your mergers and acquisitions or whatever, yes. Picking those companies is, is ridiculous. It's that long. It's hard to do it for next year, next five years, ten years, 30 to 40 years in the future is really difficult. Okay. So next we have what will bring more value in the long run for a child, paying for a fancy private college that totals $250,000 or sending them to a mid-tier public school on a full ride and putting that $250,000 into an index fund for their retirement? Listen, this is the type of question that is way easier to answer as an older person than a younger person. Like, when you're older, you can easily say, like, don't spend a lot of money on a wedding because that's a waste of money, right? Or why would you spend all this money on college when you can just invest it and start a business and go bet on yourself? Like, that's way easier to say as a younger person. Like, hey, outside of the top 15 to 20 schools, it doesn't matter where your degree came from, as long as you get one, right? But I think you use this as a teaching moment, right? So you can say option one, you go to a really expensive school, but you forego this potential will financially be set up as a young person and maybe buying your first house or paying for a wedding or whatever you want to do with the money retiring early. Or you go to a state school, but here's what you're giving up. You're not going to go to a nice expensive school that you want to. You could be missing out on experiences and which one did you regret more? You put all the information out there for me. You just as a teaching opportunity, maybe talk about compound interest a little bit before their eyes glaze over. But I say if you're going to do this, don't scold someone, don't force them, give them all the information and let them make the decisions themselves, right? Because again, your decision at A to 18, maybe they say, you know what? I'll make my own money someday. I don't need your money. I want to go to this school because my friends are going there because that is an awesome program that I want to do. Whatever. You do you help them make an adult decision and let them figure out which path is better for them? Yeah, now that sounds like good advice. Also, yeah, so much of college is about what you make it. Like, they're brilliant people who go to, you know, like less prestigious schools and end up, you know, being very successful. Well, my favorite one is private school doesn't really need that much. Oh, did we lose you been? Oh, I think we might have lost, lost been there for a second. All right. Well, let's give them a second to see if he comes back. And if he doesn't, then maybe I'll bring Matt back in. All right. So, we'll switch this up a little bit. So we'll go ahead and jump into Matt. So Matt, get ready. I'm going to get your opinion on this. What do you think about this question between the public mid-tier school and a private school? Also, I should introduce you. This is a Matt Warius, young advisor extraordinaire at Reholtz Wealth. We're going to surprise you at question 8. Sure. I'll go ahead and bring you in. Of course, don't we curve ball right off the bat here. Love it. So I agree with Bennett. It's much easier to answer this as an older person just saying, having gone through the experience of paying for these types of big events and saying, well, did I really need that? But the experiences are worth something. So, in terms of where are you going to go to school, as long as you get to go to education, I think, and even if it's a mid-tier school, if you're not paying as much money, you'll probably end up OK at the end of the day. You'll end up all right. So, I mean, don't kill yourself over. Don't feel like you have to spend godly amounts of money on school, but also at the same time, you want the experience, right? You want to be able to learn the things that don't necessarily happen in college. Meeting people and networking, all that type of stuff is important. And when we're older, it's easier to say, did I really need that? Right. Yeah, hindsight, if people aren't happy with their careers, they're always going to work back and be like, oh, I spent too much on college. But I think that some of that is hindsight bias. Also, we both went to school very close to each other. You went to coastal Carolina. On the coast of South Carolina, I went to UNCW on the coast of North Carolina. So, yeah, I had a great experience. OK, so this is uncharted territory. Then it's still not back. So, he must be having some serious computer difficulties. So, yeah, we're taking over. And, yeah, I guess we'll just continue on. So, John, John hit it. Let's go to the next question. OK. So, did we get binned back? Hold on. Let's see. Ben, thank God. I'm on my phone. The power literally just went out of my business. And I was like, how long do I give it before we just completely regroup and continue on? But this is great. It's not like we're alive or anything. Yeah, we're only, this is the power. My, the power in my whole office just literally shut down. And I'm sitting here in darkness, but I'm on my phone. So, I apologize for the video, but. No, hey, it works. It works. Where were we? So, we were wrapping up the college question. So, we're out of the next one. Matt had some good contributions there. Matt, you can hop in and help out. Yeah, yeah. So, we'll just have Matt on. I guess not too. The surprise is over. OK. Robnex, long time viewer of the show, love all the content you put out. I'm 23 and just graduated from college. I landed my first job at a financial services firm and I'm wondering how I should allocate my earnings. Would you recommend focusing on paying off my student loans first around $30,000 or building up my retirement portfolio? My boring answer to this one is I like the idea of splitting it up because I think that's the simplest way to go about it. And I think building those financial habits early and saving is important. Now, it could be one of these people that just loves paying off debt because you hate it so much. Duncan, I can't remember. You a Duke or North Carolina fan because you're from North Carolina. I'm a Duke fan. OK. So, some people hate debt as much as people outside of Durham, North Carolina, hate coach K and Duke, right? Oh, wow. Yeah. What comes from the triolic? It's pretty good to go. Come on. There's something new. But I'm just saying, if you really want to these people that just hate debt and cannot stand it and it's going to keep you up at night, paid off, I like the idea of splitting it up and building those savings habits while you pay off the debt. And then when the debts paid off, roll that those payments into your savings. For sure. I agree. I mean, you guys start contributing to the 401K, at least. I think a little bit. You don't have to do a lot, but you can do both at the same time. There's no reason why not. Yes, at least get your match. All right. Was it? So, right on time. There we go. So, one thing I had to add to that is just, yeah, the Dave Ramsey School of like no debt ever kind of thing. That always, to me, is kind of annoying because it's like, well, you're basically telling a lot of people that they can't like go to college then if they can't take out student loan debt because you should never take out. Yeah, I feel like you're saying some people are so, so extreme about it. It's kind of off. Yeah, that's a debt that's going to pay off for you. There's good and bad debt. Right. For sure. Okay. So, up next, we have my friend, who's 38 years old, has a 2.8% 30 year fixed mortgage, roughly 24 years left, and pays an extra $400 each month towards her principal. If she continues to prepay $400 towards her principal, she has about 16 years remaining. Her house has enjoyed strong appreciation in the past six years, about 85% according to Zilla. I told her I would show, I told her that I would slow pay the mortgage due to the phenomenal rate plus significant appreciation and invest the $400 a month in the stock market. What are your thoughts on this? I do think the rates matter in these things. I got my first interest rate I paid at my house like 6.5%. And we ended up refinancing a few times to the point where we kept making the same payment and it was like double by the end. But then only sold her house after 10 years, I realized like, wait, what was that money doing for me? It was illicit, it was just sitting there. It wasn't that great. I think if you have that low of a payment and it's taxed advantage, I think you have to think about that in terms of like, how are the rest of your finances? Are you on track with your retirement savings? Could you be using this money for something better than a 2.8% repayment on your house? Yeah, it's mad. Some people just don't like debt. So I mean, if that's how you are, you know, and it's that's keeping you up at night, then pay it off. Yeah, otherwise there's probably other things you could be doing with it. And that's just, you know, takes a little bit more deeper dive into your full picture. It's a really, really low hurdle rate. Yeah. Cool. We didn't even get to the buzzer on that one. So let's keep trucking along. Okay. So another fed one. What happens when the fed raises rates? Moreover, if the bond market has priced in several rate hikes, why raise rates 25 basis points per month? If 6.25 basis point hikes are priced in this year, what would happen if the fed raised to 1% in March? I don't really understand this one. I have to be honest. Okay. So they're basically saying the fed has this target that they want interest rates to get to, but they're taking their time and it's going to take them a while to get there. And if they're going to get to 2% or 3% anyway, why not just rip that band it off and do it now? So they're taking a stair step function where they're doing like little income instead of time. This is the hardest price, the hardest part of investing is like what's priced into the market? No one really knows because there are no counterfactuals. And I think the idea is like if they ripped the band it off and did this, what would they be signaling? Like, things are worse than people think. There'd be like a meltdown, some countertuitive reaction. Like maybe the bond market would be worse than the stock market in this case. I think it's mostly psychological because people can't handle big, huge changes right away. Throwing the kitchen stick, I think people would just freak out because it's so much of a psychological. Yeah, I can't believe I'm doing this for my phone. Yeah, I know. It's surreal. 45 seconds left on the timer. You have anything else? Yeah. Let's just do the next one. I know we can spend some time in that question. Okay. Hey, so up next, I'm 44 and single with no kids. I have a net worth of around $425,000. College educated and financial controller at a commercial real estate firm in Chicago. I would have more if Twitter had performed better though I didn't sell any. I, or I haven't sold any. I own 55, 5,550 shares at $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am? Okay. So this one was obviously sent to us before Elon Musk decided to happen and buy 9% of Twitter and shares shut up third percent this year. So now this guy's up like 65% on his shares. John throw the chart up of Twitter. This is Twitter since the IPO has not done great. The S&P is up like 200% since Twitter run public. Twitter is up like 15%. That includes this week's run up in prices from Elon Musk taking over. I think it's funny. This guy included Twitter in his asking how he's doing. But because I think if you're a whole financial ecosystem is based around how one stock is doing and it has to make or break you, that's kind of tough. The other thing is you have them in Monwany. The idea of answering where am I? I think that's hard to do because you have to answer where do I want to be, how much you want to spend, when do I want to retire, what are my goals. So Matt, someone comes to you and says, here's how much money I have, here's my age, here's where I want to be. How do you help them understand whether you're on the right track or not? Yeah. Every situation is different. So we really have to take a look at everything that's going on and see where do you want to be. How do you envision the rest of your life playing out and what resources do you currently have to get there and what capabilities do you have to continue to add to these goals and what's prioritized them? So I did a back of the envelope for this one. If this guy did nothing else, that $425,000 or whatever he has, here in 6% of his money, he returns to 65. He's got like $1.3 or $1.4 million. If since he's a listener of the show, he's maxing out his 401k, he's maxing out his Rolf IRA. So that's $26,000 a year call it. If he did that in addition to what he already has, he'd have like $2.3 million. So I think you take that and you say, I don't know what the market is actually going to do, but if I need more than that, I'm going to work longer. I'm going to save more. If I need less than that, maybe it can save less now or retire a little earlier. So I think that's how you look at those goal posts long away. I cheated. I just did that when we finished. I think that was all our lightener on. We did pretty good. We got through seven of them and we helped two questions from Matt. We're going to bring Matt in now before I had my technical piece. Back to the pandemic. Back to the pandemic. There's a storm here today. So yeah, my power went out. But let's do a couple more. We got one floor that we've got from Matt here. And by the way, a lot of these questions, I think are from younger viewers, which I think is great. And a lot of these. So we want to bring Matt in since he specializes working with some younger investors. So let's ask a question here. Okay. So what are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor? Especially as a young person. All right. Really great question. Because I think this is one of the hardest things for people to understand. Like, I don't know because you go to the hospital and they give you a doctor. You don't like to select them. A lot of things. You don't really know what you're looking for. So Matt, why don't you talk about when you're talking to prospective clients? What are the things they should be looking for? And what are some of the red flags that maybe they shouldn't be asking questions about? Yeah, definitely. It's a great question. I think anyone looking for an advisor, you have to be seeking out a long-term relationship. You want something that's going to last. You don't want to hop around a bunch, go from advisor to advisor. So you really want to take it seriously. You want to do your due diligence and you want to ask the right questions. There are wrong questions to ask as well. So right questions being obviously the obvious ones. Are you a fiduciary? Are you going to serve my best interests at all times? If you're a younger investor, I think a key question is, how do I fit into your firm's philosophy, given where I am in life right now? And how is that path going to evolve for me as a client of the firm? And what you're like, as a young person, you could have certain things that are going on in your life and you have life events that change. So it's like, how can you help me along the way as I have these changes happen? Right. So what are the services that I should be seeking out right now that you can provide to me? How will that change? And then what are the fees around those services? Do the fees change? Right. Obviously, you don't want to be paying a ton of money for stuff you don't need. So you want to be cognizant of that as well, I think. So you know, and then we can get into like investment philosophy. If you're someone who is a little bit more experienced when it comes to investing, you've done some on your own, right? Obviously, you want to make the relationship as easy as possible to be able to stick with it for a long time. So you want to make sure philosophy is aligned, I think. Yeah. I also think one of the most important things is like, what does a relationship look like going forward? Like, how are you going to work with me? How often are we going to talk and communicate? Because I know that can vary for our clients. Some people want to have their hand held and talk all the time. Some people want check-ins, you know, irregularly. So it kind of depends like, how are you going to work with me and how are you going to fit with my schedule and personality? Yeah, I think the key is expectations have to be aligned in the beginning. So spend time with whoever you're talking to, talk to more than one firm, and really make sure that you're getting, you're setting out on the right foot in terms of what the expectations are. For both, the advisor and the client. And both should desire the same thing in terms of having a long-term relationship that's beneficial to most importantly the client. Right. A lot of it comes down to, here's what I want out of you. Can you actually fill what I want? Or are you just telling me what I want to hear? I agree. Yeah, definitely. Do you ever get any like personal questions like your favorite music or sports or stuff like that? I mean, because it seems like people would naturally want to know that stuff if they're going to have a long-term relationship. Definitely. That's the fun part is getting to know people and really getting to mesh with certain people and see, hey, do we even get along? Sometimes you don't get along with somebody. Has nothing to do with finance or numbers or your financial plans and it's like, all right, we just get along and I trust this person. I think trust is a huge thing. Obviously, it seems obvious, but you want to trust whoever you're seeking out as an advisor. So that a lot of times you want to work with someone that you like and respect and trust I think is the big aunt for sure. Yeah, I would need to ask favorite Beatles album. Sorry, I just put them in the chat. No, I'm just kidding. By the way, I think that Dunkin' Worst podcast question ever. Beatles or Stones, right? Oh, because of the obviousness of it, it's like it's not even a contest. Well, it's also like, yes, it's, yes, okay. I'll see the next one. I probably just made a bunch of people mad. Okay. So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because this is a huge, we're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know, six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying. Yeah, like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity cost, right? What are the goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into equity in your home could be used for? Right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want a front load of five to nine plan and you some of this money for that. So that's just one example, but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, hey, I saved up the money. Should I just throw it on to my house? I also think interest. Especially when you're young, borrowing money makes more sense to me because especially with the house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if you realize a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually, right? You still have that cash somewhere. So I think that, that is the kind of thing where it's, it's hard to take that one back if you buy the house and all cash. Obviously, maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding, we're having all cash could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you lose some flexibility by just having it paid off. Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is pretty big, I think. I mean, a couple months ago, you know, it's, it's, like you said, it's more obvious, but still, even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other parts of your life, having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, is, it could be restraining a little bit. But again, you got these people, they just hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know, the conversation's going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation if it's required for the person that we're dealing with. Duncan, I'm not going to make a coach K Duke reference here because I know it's, it's a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize. It's rough. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's been rough. It's a tough way for them to go out. But literally the worst team they could have lost to, you know, everyone knows I guess. Yeah, they had to be tough. All right. Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years now almost and I've never lost power before. So, yeah, glad I could be the one on here today to experience another time. I think Matt was stepping in. We got to mention no portfolio rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami recording a live additional mental spirits that if we figured out, I can hopefully go up on this channel at some point. Keep those questions and comments coming. Remember, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Come. Thanks guys. Thanks for watching and we're back in two weeks. One, one of the things, don't forget we're also available as a podcast wherever you listen to podcasts. So make sure you've subscribed and give us a rating. All that kind of stuff. It helps a lot. So yeah, thanks. We have a fancy new cover with Duncan and I on it. Our pictures. It looks amazing. It's feel famous. All right. Thanks everyone for watching. See you.","[0.007960245013237, -0.016206976026296616, 0.011561795137822628, -0.03470584750175476, -0.017816759645938873, 0.012059736996889114, -0.01933104917407036, -0.03290507197380066,

85,85,Episode 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxhrPdZdog,05:16 ,316,0, What will bring more value in the long run for a child?," What will bring more value in the long run for a child? So next we have what will bring more value in the long run for a child, paying for a fancy private college that totals $250,000 or sending them to a mid-tier public school on a full ride and putting that $250,000 into an index fund for their retirement? Listen, this is the type of question that is way easier to answer as an older person than a younger person. Like, when you're older, you can easily say, like, don't spend a lot of money on a wedding because that's a waste of money, right? Or why would you spend all this money on college when you can just invest it and start a business and go bet on yourself? Like, that's way easier to say as a younger person. Like, hey, outside of the top 15 to 20 schools, it doesn't matter where your degree came from, as long as you get one, right? But I think you use this as a teaching moment, right? So you can say option one, you go to a really expensive school, but you forego this potential will financially be set up as a young person and maybe buying your first house or paying for a wedding or whatever you want to do with the money retiring early. Or you go to a state school, but here's what you're giving up. You're not going to go to a nice expensive school that you want to. You could be missing out on experiences and which one did you regret more? You put all the information out there for me. You just as a teaching opportunity, maybe talk about compound interest a little bit before their eyes glaze over. But I say if you're going to do this, don't scold someone, don't force them, give them all the information and let them make the decisions themselves, right? Because again, your decision at A to 18, maybe they say, you know what? I'll make my own money someday. I don't need your money. I want to go to this school because my friends are going there because that is an awesome program that I want to do. Whatever. You do you help them make an adult decision and let them figure out which path is better for them? Yeah, now that sounds like good advice. Also, yeah, so much of college is about what you make it. Like, they're brilliant people who go to, you know, like less prestigious schools and end up, you know, being very successful. Well, my favorite one is private school doesn't really need that much. Oh, did we lose you been? Oh, I think we might have lost, lost been there for a second. All right. Well, let's give them a second to see if he comes back. And if he doesn't, then maybe I'll bring Matt back in. All right. So, we'll switch this up a little bit. So we'll go ahead and jump into Matt. So Matt, get ready. I'm going to get your opinion on this. What do you think about this question between the public mid-tier school and a private school? Also, I should introduce you. This is a Matt Warius, young advisor extraordinaire at Reholtz Wealth. We're going to surprise you at question 8. Sure. I'll go ahead and bring you in. Of course, don't we curve ball right off the bat here. Love it. So I agree with Bennett. It's much easier to answer this as an older person just saying, having gone through the experience of paying for these types of big events and saying, well, did I really need that? But the experiences are worth something. So, in terms of where are you going to go to school, as long as you get to go to education, I think, and even if it's a mid-tier school, if you're not paying as much money, you'll probably end up OK at the end of the day. You'll end up all right. So, I mean, don't kill yourself over. Don't feel like you have to spend godly amounts of money on school, but also at the same time, you want the experience, right? You want to be able to learn the things that don't necessarily happen in college. Meeting people and networking, all that type of stuff is important. And when we're older, it's easier to say, did I really need that? Right. Yeah, hindsight, if people aren't happy with their careers, they're always going to work back and be like, oh, I spent too much on college. But I think that some of that is hindsight bias. Also, we both went to school very close to each other. You went to coastal Carolina. On the coast of South Carolina, I went to UNCW on the coast of North Carolina. So, yeah, I had a great experience. OK, so this is uncharted territory. Then it's still not back. So, he must be having some serious computer difficulties. So, yeah, we're taking over. And, yeah, I guess we'll just continue on. So, John, John hit it. Let's go to the next question. OK. So, did we get binned back? Hold on. Let's see. Ben, thank God. I'm on my phone. The power literally just went out of my business. And I was like, how long do I give it before we just completely regroup and continue on? But this is great. It's not like we're alive or anything. Yeah, we're only, this is the power. My, the power in my whole office just literally shut down. And I'm sitting here in darkness, but I'm on my phone. So, I apologize for the video, but. No, hey, it works. It works. Where were we? So, we were wrapping up the college question. So, we're out of the next one. Matt had some good contributions there. Matt, you can hop in and help out. Yeah, yeah. So, we'll just have Matt on. I guess not too. The surprise is over. OK. Robnex, long time viewer of the show, love all the content you put out. I'm 23 and just graduated from college. I landed my first job at a financial services firm and I'm wondering how I should allocate my earnings. Would you recommend focusing on paying off my student loans first around $30,000 or building up my retirement portfolio? My boring answer to this one is I like the idea of splitting it up because I think that's the simplest way to go about it. And I think building those financial habits early and saving is important. Now, it could be one of these people that just loves paying off debt because you hate it so much. Duncan, I can't remember. You a Duke or North Carolina fan because you're from North Carolina. I'm a Duke fan. OK. So, some people hate debt as much as people outside of Durham, North Carolina, hate coach K and Duke, right? Oh, wow. Yeah. What comes from the triolic? It's pretty good to go. Come on. There's something new. But I'm just saying, if you really want to these people that just hate debt and cannot stand it and it's going to keep you up at night, paid off, I like the idea of splitting it up and building those savings habits while you pay off the debt. And then when the debts paid off, roll that those payments into your savings. For sure. I agree. I mean, you guys start contributing to the 401K, at least. I think a little bit. You don't have to do a lot, but you can do both at the same time. There's no reason why not. Yes, at least get your match. All right. Was it? So, right on time. There we go. So, one thing I had to add to that is just, yeah, the Dave Ramsey School of like no debt ever kind of thing. That always, to me, is kind of annoying because it's like, well, you're basically telling a lot of people that they can't like go to college then if they can't take out student loan debt because you should never take out. Yeah, I feel like you're saying some people are so, so extreme about it. It's kind of off. Yeah, that's a debt that's going to pay off for you. There's good and bad debt. Right. For sure. Okay. So, up next, we have my friend, who's 38 years old, has a 2.8% 30 year fixed mortgage, roughly 24 years left, and pays an extra $400 each month towards her principal. If she continues to prepay $400 towards her principal, she has about 16 years remaining. Her house has enjoyed strong appreciation in the past six years, about 85% according to Zilla. I told her I would show, I told her that I would slow pay the mortgage due to the phenomenal rate plus significant appreciation and invest the $400 a month in the stock market. What are your thoughts on this? I do think the rates matter in these things. I got my first interest rate I paid at my house like 6.5%. And we ended up refinancing a few times to the point where we kept making the same payment and it was like double by the end. But then only sold her house after 10 years, I realized like, wait, what was that money doing for me? It was illicit, it was just sitting there. It wasn't that great. I think if you have that low of a payment and it's taxed advantage, I think you have to think about that in terms of like, how are the rest of your finances? Are you on track with your retirement savings? Could you be using this money for something better than a 2.8% repayment on your house? Yeah, it's mad. Some people just don't like debt. So I mean, if that's how you are, you know, and it's that's keeping you up at night, then pay it off. Yeah, otherwise there's probably other things you could be doing with it. And that's just, you know, takes a little bit more deeper dive into your full picture. It's a really, really low hurdle rate. Yeah. Cool. We didn't even get to the buzzer on that one. So let's keep trucking along. Okay. So another fed one. What happens when the fed raises rates? Moreover, if the bond market has priced in several rate hikes, why raise rates 25 basis points per month? If 6.25 basis point hikes are priced in this year, what would happen if the fed raised to 1% in March? I don't really understand this one. I have to be honest. Okay. So they're basically saying the fed has this target that they want interest rates to get to, but they're taking their time and it's going to take them a while to get there. And if they're going to get to 2% or 3% anyway, why not just rip that band it off and do it now? So they're taking a stair step function where they're doing like little income instead of time. This is the hardest price, the hardest part of investing is like what's priced into the market? No one really knows because there are no counterfactuals. And I think the idea is like if they ripped the band it off and did this, what would they be signaling? Like, things are worse than people think. There'd be like a meltdown, some countertuitive reaction. Like maybe the bond market would be worse than the stock market in this case. I think it's mostly psychological because people can't handle big, huge changes right away. Throwing the kitchen stick, I think people would just freak out because it's so much of a psychological. Yeah, I can't believe I'm doing this for my phone. Yeah, I know. It's surreal. 45 seconds left on the timer. You have anything else? Yeah. Let's just do the next one. I know we can spend some time in that question. Okay. Hey, so up next, I'm 44 and single with no kids. I have a net worth of around $425,000. College educated and financial controller at a commercial real estate firm in Chicago. I would have more if Twitter had performed better though I didn't sell any. I, or I haven't sold any. I own 55, 5,550 shares at $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am? Okay. So this one was obviously sent to us before Elon Musk decided to happen and buy 9% of Twitter and shares shut up third percent this year. So now this guy's up like 65% on his shares. John throw the chart up of Twitter. This is Twitter since the IPO has not done great. The S&P is up like 200% since Twitter run public. Twitter is up like 15%. That includes this week's run up in prices from Elon Musk taking over. I think it's funny. This guy included Twitter in his asking how he's doing. But because I think if you're a whole financial ecosystem is based around how one stock is doing and it has to make or break you, that's kind of tough. The other thing is you have them in Monwany. The idea of answering where am I? I think that's hard to do because you have to answer where do I want to be, how much you want to spend, when do I want to retire, what are my goals. So Matt, someone comes to you and says, here's how much money I have, here's my age, here's where I want to be. How do you help them understand whether you're on the right track or not? Yeah. Every situation is different. So we really have to take a look at everything that's going on and see where do you want to be. How do you envision the rest of your life playing out and what resources do you currently have to get there and what capabilities do you have to continue to add to these goals and what's prioritized them? So I did a back of the envelope for this one. If this guy did nothing else, that $425,000 or whatever he has, here in 6% of his money, he returns to 65. He's got like $1.3 or $1.4 million. If since he's a listener of the show, he's maxing out his 401k, he's maxing out his Rolf IRA. So that's $26,000 a year call it. If he did that in addition to what he already has, he'd have like $2.3 million. So I think you take that and you say, I don't know what the market is actually going to do, but if I need more than that, I'm going to work longer. I'm going to save more. If I need less than that, maybe it can save less now or retire a little earlier. So I think that's how you look at those goal posts long away. I cheated. I just did that when we finished. I think that was all our lightener on. We did pretty good. We got through seven of them and we helped two questions from Matt. We're going to bring Matt in now before I had my technical piece. Back to the pandemic. Back to the pandemic. There's a storm here today. So yeah, my power went out. But let's do a couple more. We got one floor that we've got from Matt here. And by the way, a lot of these questions, I think are from younger viewers, which I think is great. And a lot of these. So we want to bring Matt in since he specializes working with some younger investors. So let's ask a question here. Okay. So what are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor? Especially as a young person. All right. Really great question. Because I think this is one of the hardest things for people to understand. Like, I don't know because you go to the hospital and they give you a doctor. You don't like to select them. A lot of things. You don't really know what you're looking for. So Matt, why don't you talk about when you're talking to prospective clients? What are the things they should be looking for? And what are some of the red flags that maybe they shouldn't be asking questions about? Yeah, definitely. It's a great question. I think anyone looking for an advisor, you have to be seeking out a long-term relationship. You want something that's going to last. You don't want to hop around a bunch, go from advisor to advisor. So you really want to take it seriously. You want to do your due diligence and you want to ask the right questions. There are wrong questions to ask as well. So right questions being obviously the obvious ones. Are you a fiduciary? Are you going to serve my best interests at all times? If you're a younger investor, I think a key question is, how do I fit into your firm's philosophy, given where I am in life right now? And how is that path going to evolve for me as a client of the firm? And what you're like, as a young person, you could have certain things that are going on in your life and you have life events that change. So it's like, how can you help me along the way as I have these changes happen? Right. So what are the services that I should be seeking out right now that you can provide to me? How will that change? And then what are the fees around those services? Do the fees change? Right. Obviously, you don't want to be paying a ton of money for stuff you don't need. So you want to be cognizant of that as well, I think. So you know, and then we can get into like investment philosophy. If you're someone who is a little bit more experienced when it comes to investing, you've done some on your own, right? Obviously, you want to make the relationship as easy as possible to be able to stick with it for a long time. So you want to make sure philosophy is aligned, I think. Yeah. I also think one of the most important things is like, what does a relationship look like going forward? Like, how are you going to work with me? How often are we going to talk and communicate? Because I know that can vary for our clients. Some people want to have their hand held and talk all the time. Some people want check-ins, you know, irregularly. So it kind of depends like, how are you going to work with me and how are you going to fit with my schedule and personality? Yeah, I think the key is expectations have to be aligned in the beginning. So spend time with whoever you're talking to, talk to more than one firm, and really make sure that you're getting, you're setting out on the right foot in terms of what the expectations are. For both, the advisor and the client. And both should desire the same thing in terms of having a long-term relationship that's beneficial to most importantly the client. Right. A lot of it comes down to, here's what I want out of you. Can you actually fill what I want? Or are you just telling me what I want to hear? I agree. Yeah, definitely. Do you ever get any like personal questions like your favorite music or sports or stuff like that? I mean, because it seems like people would naturally want to know that stuff if they're going to have a long-term relationship. Definitely. That's the fun part is getting to know people and really getting to mesh with certain people and see, hey, do we even get along? Sometimes you don't get along with somebody. Has nothing to do with finance or numbers or your financial plans and it's like, all right, we just get along and I trust this person. I think trust is a huge thing. Obviously, it seems obvious, but you want to trust whoever you're seeking out as an advisor. So that a lot of times you want to work with someone that you like and respect and trust I think is the big aunt for sure. Yeah, I would need to ask favorite Beatles album. Sorry, I just put them in the chat. No, I'm just kidding. By the way, I think that Dunkin' Worst podcast question ever. Beatles or Stones, right? Oh, because of the obviousness of it, it's like it's not even a contest. Well, it's also like, yes, it's, yes, okay. I'll see the next one. I probably just made a bunch of people mad. Okay. So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because this is a huge, we're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know, six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying. Yeah, like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity cost, right? What are the goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into equity in your home could be used for? Right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want a front load of five to nine plan and you some of this money for that. So that's just one example, but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, hey, I saved up the money. Should I just throw it on to my house? I also think interest. Especially when you're young, borrowing money makes more sense to me because especially with the house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if you realize a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually, right? You still have that cash somewhere. So I think that, that is the kind of thing where it's, it's hard to take that one back if you buy the house and all cash. Obviously, maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding, we're having all cash could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you lose some flexibility by just having it paid off. Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is pretty big, I think. I mean, a couple months ago, you know, it's, it's, like you said, it's more obvious, but still, even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other parts of your life, having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, is, it could be restraining a little bit. But again, you got these people, they just hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know, the conversation's going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation if it's required for the person that we're dealing with. Duncan, I'm not going to make a coach K Duke reference here because I know it's, it's a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize. It's rough. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's been rough. It's a tough way for them to go out. But literally the worst team they could have lost to, you know, everyone knows I guess. Yeah, they had to be tough. All right. Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years now almost and I've never lost power before. So, yeah, glad I could be the one on here today to experience another time. I think Matt was stepping in. We got to mention no portfolio rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami recording a live additional mental spirits that if we figured out, I can hopefully go up on this channel at some point.

86,86,Episode 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxhrPdZdog,10:18 ,618,0, Would you recommend focusing on paying off my student loans first? Or should I begin building my portfolio? ," Would you recommend focusing on paying off my student loans first? Or should I begin building my portfolio?  The surprise is over. OK. Robnex, long time viewer of the show, love all the content you put out. I'm 23 and just graduated from college. I landed my first job at a financial services firm and I'm wondering how I should allocate my earnings. Would you recommend focusing on paying off my student loans first around $30,000 or building up my retirement portfolio? My boring answer to this one is I like the idea of splitting it up because I think that's the simplest way to go about it. And I think building those financial habits early and saving is important. Now, it could be one of these people that just loves paying off debt because you hate it so much. Duncan, I can't remember. You a Duke or North Carolina fan because you're from North Carolina. I'm a Duke fan. OK. So, some people hate debt as much as people outside of Durham, North Carolina, hate coach K and Duke, right? Oh, wow. Yeah. What comes from the triolic? It's pretty good to go. Come on. There's something new. But I'm just saying, if you really want to these people that just hate debt and cannot stand it and it's going to keep you up at night, paid off, I like the idea of splitting it up and building those savings habits while you pay off the debt. And then when the debts paid off, roll that those payments into your savings. For sure. I agree. I mean, you guys start contributing to the 401K, at least. I think a little bit. You don't have to do a lot, but you can do both at the same time. There's no reason why not. Yes, at least get your match. All right. Was it? So, right on time. There we go. So, one thing I had to add to that is just, yeah, the Dave Ramsey School of like no debt ever kind of thing. That always, to me, is kind of annoying because it's like, well, you're basically telling a lot of people that they can't like go to college then if they can't take out student loan debt because you should never take out. Yeah, I feel like you're saying some people are so, so extreme about it. It's kind of off. Yeah, that's a debt that's going to pay off for you. There's good and bad debt. Right. For sure. Okay. So, up next, we have my friend, who's 38 years old, has a 2.8% 30 year fixed mortgage, roughly 24 years left, and pays an extra $400 each month towards her principal. If she continues to prepay $400 towards her principal, she has about 16 years remaining. Her house has enjoyed strong appreciation in the past six years, about 85% according to Zilla. I told her I would show, I told her that I would slow pay the mortgage due to the phenomenal rate plus significant appreciation and invest the $400 a month in the stock market. What are your thoughts on this? I do think the rates matter in these things. I got my first interest rate I paid at my house like 6.5%. And we ended up refinancing a few times to the point where we kept making the same payment and it was like double by the end. But then only sold her house after 10 years, I realized like, wait, what was that money doing for me? It was illicit, it was just sitting there. It wasn't that great. I think if you have that low of a payment and it's taxed advantage, I think you have to think about that in terms of like, how are the rest of your finances? Are you on track with your retirement savings? Could you be using this money for something better than a 2.8% repayment on your house? Yeah, it's mad. Some people just don't like debt. So I mean, if that's how you are, you know, and it's that's keeping you up at night, then pay it off. Yeah, otherwise there's probably other things you could be doing with it. And that's just, you know, takes a little bit more deeper dive into your full picture. It's a really, really low hurdle rate. Yeah. Cool. We didn't even get to the buzzer on that one. So let's keep trucking along. Okay. So another fed one. What happens when the fed raises rates? Moreover, if the bond market has priced in several rate hikes, why raise rates 25 basis points per month? If 6.25 basis point hikes are priced in this year, what would happen if the fed raised to 1% in March? I don't really understand this one. I have to be honest. Okay. So they're basically saying the fed has this target that they want interest rates to get to, but they're taking their time and it's going to take them a while to get there. And if they're going to get to 2% or 3% anyway, why not just rip that band it off and do it now? So they're taking a stair step function where they're doing like little income instead of time. This is the hardest price, the hardest part of investing is like what's priced into the market? No one really knows because there are no counterfactuals. And I think the idea is like if they ripped the band it off and did this, what would they be signaling? Like, things are worse than people think. There'd be like a meltdown, some countertuitive reaction. Like maybe the bond market would be worse than the stock market in this case. I think it's mostly psychological because people can't handle big, huge changes right away. Throwing the kitchen stick, I think people would just freak out because it's so much of a psychological. Yeah, I can't believe I'm doing this for my phone. Yeah, I know. It's surreal. 45 seconds left on the timer. You have anything else? Yeah. Let's just do the next one. I know we can spend some time in that question. Okay. Hey, so up next, I'm 44 and single with no kids. I have a net worth of around $425,000. College educated and financial controller at a commercial real estate firm in Chicago. I would have more if Twitter had performed better though I didn't sell any. I, or I haven't sold any. I own 55, 5,550 shares at $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am? Okay. So this one was obviously sent to us before Elon Musk decided to happen and buy 9% of Twitter and shares shut up third percent this year. So now this guy's up like 65% on his shares. John throw the chart up of Twitter. This is Twitter since the IPO has not done great. The S&P is up like 200% since Twitter run public. Twitter is up like 15%. That includes this week's run up in prices from Elon Musk taking over. I think it's funny. This guy included Twitter in his asking how he's doing. But because I think if you're a whole financial ecosystem is based around how one stock is doing and it has to make or break you, that's kind of tough. The other thing is you have them in Monwany. The idea of answering where am I? I think that's hard to do because you have to answer where do I want to be, how much you want to spend, when do I want to retire, what are my goals. So Matt, someone comes to you and says, here's how much money I have, here's my age, here's where I want to be. How do you help them understand whether you're on the right track or not? Yeah. Every situation is different. So we really have to take a look at everything that's going on and see where do you want to be. How do you envision the rest of your life playing out and what resources do you currently have to get there and what capabilities do you have to continue to add to these goals and what's prioritized them? So I did a back of the envelope for this one. If this guy did nothing else, that $425,000 or whatever he has, here in 6% of his money, he returns to 65. He's got like $1.3 or $1.4 million. If since he's a listener of the show, he's maxing out his 401k, he's maxing out his Rolf IRA. So that's $26,000 a year call it. If he did that in addition to what he already has, he'd have like $2.3 million. So I think you take that and you say, I don't know what the market is actually going to do, but if I need more than that, I'm going to work longer. I'm going to save more. If I need less than that, maybe it can save less now or retire a little earlier. So I think that's how you look at those goal posts long away. I cheated. I just did that when we finished. I think that was all our lightener on. We did pretty good. We got through seven of them and we helped two questions from Matt. We're going to bring Matt in now before I had my technical piece. Back to the pandemic. Back to the pandemic. There's a storm here today. So yeah, my power went out. But let's do a couple more. We got one floor that we've got from Matt here. And by the way, a lot of these questions, I think are from younger viewers, which I think is great. And a lot of these. So we want to bring Matt in since he specializes working with some younger investors. So let's ask a question here. Okay. So what are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor? Especially as a young person. All right. Really great question. Because I think this is one of the hardest things for people to understand. Like, I don't know because you go to the hospital and they give you a doctor. You don't like to select them. A lot of things. You don't really know what you're looking for. So Matt, why don't you talk about when you're talking to prospective clients? What are the things they should be looking for? And what are some of the red flags that maybe they shouldn't be asking questions about? Yeah, definitely. It's a great question. I think anyone looking for an advisor, you have to be seeking out a long-term relationship. You want something that's going to last. You don't want to hop around a bunch, go from advisor to advisor. So you really want to take it seriously. You want to do your due diligence and you want to ask the right questions. There are wrong questions to ask as well. So right questions being obviously the obvious ones. Are you a fiduciary? Are you going to serve my best interests at all times? If you're a younger investor, I think a key question is, how do I fit into your firm's philosophy, given where I am in life right now? And how is that path going to evolve for me as a client of the firm? And what you're like, as a young person, you could have certain things that are going on in your life and you have life events that change. So it's like, how can you help me along the way as I have these changes happen? Right. So what are the services that I should be seeking out right now that you can provide to me? How will that change? And then what are the fees around those services? Do the fees change? Right. Obviously, you don't want to be paying a ton of money for stuff you don't need. So you want to be cognizant of that as well, I think. So you know, and then we can get into like investment philosophy. If you're someone who is a little bit more experienced when it comes to investing, you've done some on your own, right? Obviously, you want to make the relationship as easy as possible to be able to stick with it for a long time. So you want to make sure philosophy is aligned, I think. Yeah. I also think one of the most important things is like, what does a relationship look like going forward? Like, how are you going to work with me? How often are we going to talk and communicate? Because I know that can vary for our clients. Some people want to have their hand held and talk all the time. Some people want check-ins, you know, irregularly. So it kind of depends like, how are you going to work with me and how are you going to fit with my schedule and personality? Yeah, I think the key is expectations have to be aligned in the beginning. So spend time with whoever you're talking to, talk to more than one firm, and really make sure that you're getting, you're setting out on the right foot in terms of what the expectations are. For both, the advisor and the client. And both should desire the same thing in terms of having a long-term relationship that's beneficial to most importantly the client. Right. A lot of it comes down to, here's what I want out of you. Can you actually fill what I want? Or are you just telling me what I want to hear? I agree. Yeah, definitely. Do you ever get any like personal questions like your favorite music or sports or stuff like that? I mean, because it seems like people would naturally want to know that stuff if they're going to have a long-term relationship. Definitely. That's the fun part is getting to know people and really getting to mesh with certain people and see, hey, do we even get along? Sometimes you don't get along with somebody. Has nothing to do with finance or numbers or your financial plans and it's like, all right, we just get along and I trust this person. I think trust is a huge thing. Obviously, it seems obvious, but you want to trust whoever you're seeking out as an advisor. So that a lot of times you want to work with someone that you like and respect and trust I think is the big aunt for sure. Yeah, I would need to ask favorite Beatles album. Sorry, I just put them in the chat. No, I'm just kidding. By the way, I think that Dunkin' Worst podcast question ever. Beatles or Stones, right? Oh, because of the obviousness of it, it's like it's not even a contest. Well, it's also like, yes, it's, yes, okay. I'll see the next one. I probably just made a bunch of people mad. Okay. So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because this is a huge, we're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know, six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying. Yeah, like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity cost, right? What are the goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into equity in your home could be used for? Right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want a front load of five to nine plan and you some of this money for that. So that's just one example, but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, hey, I saved up the money. Should I just throw it on to my house? I also think interest. Especially when you're young, borrowing money makes more sense to me because especially with the house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if you realize a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually, right? You still have that cash somewhere. So I think that, that is the kind of thing where it's, it's hard to take that one back if you buy the house and all cash. Obviously, maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding, we're having all cash could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you lose some flexibility by just having it paid off. Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is pretty big, I think. I mean, a couple months ago, you know, it's, it's, like you said, it's more obvious, but still, even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other parts of your life, having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, is, it could be restraining a little bit. But again, you got these people, they just hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know, the conversation's going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation if it's required for the person that we're dealing with. Duncan, I'm not going to make a coach K Duke reference here because I know it's, it's a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize. It's rough. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's been rough. It's a tough way for them to go out. But literally the worst team they could have lost to, you know, everyone knows I guess. Yeah, they had to be tough. All right. Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years now almost and I've never lost power before. So, yeah, glad I could be the one on here today to experience another time. I think Matt was stepping in. We got to mention no portfolio rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami recording a live additional mental spirits that if we figured out, I can hopefully go up on this channel at some point.

87,87,Episode 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxhrPdZdog,11:57 ,717,0, Paying off a mortgage.," Paying off a mortgage. For sure. Okay. So, up next, we have my friend, who's 38 years old, has a 2.8% 30 year fixed mortgage, roughly 24 years left, and pays an extra $400 each month towards her principal. If she continues to prepay $400 towards her principal, she has about 16 years remaining. Her house has enjoyed strong appreciation in the past six years, about 85% according to Zilla. I told her I would show, I told her that I would slow pay the mortgage due to the phenomenal rate plus significant appreciation and invest the $400 a month in the stock market. What are your thoughts on this? I do think the rates matter in these things. I got my first interest rate I paid at my house like 6.5%. And we ended up refinancing a few times to the point where we kept making the same payment and it was like double by the end. But then only sold her house after 10 years, I realized like, wait, what was that money doing for me? It was illicit, it was just sitting there. It wasn't that great. I think if you have that low of a payment and it's taxed advantage, I think you have to think about that in terms of like, how are the rest of your finances? Are you on track with your retirement savings? Could you be using this money for something better than a 2.8% repayment on your house? Yeah, it's mad. Some people just don't like debt. So I mean, if that's how you are, you know, and it's that's keeping you up at night, then pay it off. Yeah, otherwise there's probably other things you could be doing with it. And that's just, you know, takes a little bit more deeper dive into your full picture. It's a really, really low hurdle rate. Yeah. Cool. We didn't even get to the buzzer on that one. So let's keep trucking along. Okay. So another fed one. What happens when the fed raises rates? Moreover, if the bond market has priced in several rate hikes, why raise rates 25 basis points per month? If 6.25 basis point hikes are priced in this year, what would happen if the fed raised to 1% in March? I don't really understand this one. I have to be honest. Okay. So they're basically saying the fed has this target that they want interest rates to get to, but they're taking their time and it's going to take them a while to get there. And if they're going to get to 2% or 3% anyway, why not just rip that band it off and do it now? So they're taking a stair step function where they're doing like little income instead of time. This is the hardest price, the hardest part of investing is like what's priced into the market? No one really knows because there are no counterfactuals. And I think the idea is like if they ripped the band it off and did this, what would they be signaling? Like, things are worse than people think. There'd be like a meltdown, some countertuitive reaction. Like maybe the bond market would be worse than the stock market in this case. I think it's mostly psychological because people can't handle big, huge changes right away. Throwing the kitchen stick, I think people would just freak out because it's so much of a psychological. Yeah, I can't believe I'm doing this for my phone. Yeah, I know. It's surreal. 45 seconds left on the timer. You have anything else? Yeah. Let's just do the next one. I know we can spend some time in that question. Okay. Hey, so up next, I'm 44 and single with no kids. I have a net worth of around $425,000. College educated and financial controller at a commercial real estate firm in Chicago. I would have more if Twitter had performed better though I didn't sell any. I, or I haven't sold any. I own 55, 5,550 shares at $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am? Okay. So this one was obviously sent to us before Elon Musk decided to happen and buy 9% of Twitter and shares shut up third percent this year. So now this guy's up like 65% on his shares. John throw the chart up of Twitter. This is Twitter since the IPO has not done great. The S&P is up like 200% since Twitter run public. Twitter is up like 15%. That includes this week's run up in prices from Elon Musk taking over. I think it's funny. This guy included Twitter in his asking how he's doing. But because I think if you're a whole financial ecosystem is based around how one stock is doing and it has to make or break you, that's kind of tough. The other thing is you have them in Monwany. The idea of answering where am I? I think that's hard to do because you have to answer where do I want to be, how much you want to spend, when do I want to retire, what are my goals. So Matt, someone comes to you and says, here's how much money I have, here's my age, here's where I want to be. How do you help them understand whether you're on the right track or not? Yeah. Every situation is different. So we really have to take a look at everything that's going on and see where do you want to be. How do you envision the rest of your life playing out and what resources do you currently have to get there and what capabilities do you have to continue to add to these goals and what's prioritized them? So I did a back of the envelope for this one. If this guy did nothing else, that $425,000 or whatever he has, here in 6% of his money, he returns to 65. He's got like $1.3 or $1.4 million. If since he's a listener of the show, he's maxing out his 401k, he's maxing out his Rolf IRA. So that's $26,000 a year call it. If he did that in addition to what he already has, he'd have like $2.3 million. So I think you take that and you say, I don't know what the market is actually going to do, but if I need more than that, I'm going to work longer. I'm going to save more. If I need less than that, maybe it can save less now or retire a little earlier. So I think that's how you look at those goal posts long away. I cheated. I just did that when we finished. I think that was all our lightener on. We did pretty good. We got through seven of them and we helped two questions from Matt. We're going to bring Matt in now before I had my technical piece. Back to the pandemic. Back to the pandemic. There's a storm here today. So yeah, my power went out. But let's do a couple more. We got one floor that we've got from Matt here. And by the way, a lot of these questions, I think are from younger viewers, which I think is great. And a lot of these. So we want to bring Matt in since he specializes working with some younger investors. So let's ask a question here. Okay. So what are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor? Especially as a young person. All right. Really great question. Because I think this is one of the hardest things for people to understand. Like, I don't know because you go to the hospital and they give you a doctor. You don't like to select them. A lot of things. You don't really know what you're looking for. So Matt, why don't you talk about when you're talking to prospective clients? What are the things they should be looking for? And what are some of the red flags that maybe they shouldn't be asking questions about? Yeah, definitely. It's a great question. I think anyone looking for an advisor, you have to be seeking out a long-term relationship. You want something that's going to last. You don't want to hop around a bunch, go from advisor to advisor. So you really want to take it seriously. You want to do your due diligence and you want to ask the right questions. There are wrong questions to ask as well. So right questions being obviously the obvious ones. Are you a fiduciary? Are you going to serve my best interests at all times? If you're a younger investor, I think a key question is, how do I fit into your firm's philosophy, given where I am in life right now? And how is that path going to evolve for me as a client of the firm? And what you're like, as a young person, you could have certain things that are going on in your life and you have life events that change. So it's like, how can you help me along the way as I have these changes happen? Right. So what are the services that I should be seeking out right now that you can provide to me? How will that change? And then what are the fees around those services? Do the fees change? Right. Obviously, you don't want to be paying a ton of money for stuff you don't need. So you want to be cognizant of that as well, I think. So you know, and then we can get into like investment philosophy. If you're someone who is a little bit more experienced when it comes to investing, you've done some on your own, right? Obviously, you want to make the relationship as easy as possible to be able to stick with it for a long time. So you want to make sure philosophy is aligned, I think. Yeah. I also think one of the most important things is like, what does a relationship look like going forward? Like, how are you going to work with me? How often are we going to talk and communicate? Because I know that can vary for our clients. Some people want to have their hand held and talk all the time. Some people want check-ins, you know, irregularly. So it kind of depends like, how are you going to work with me and how are you going to fit with my schedule and personality? Yeah, I think the key is expectations have to be aligned in the beginning. So spend time with whoever you're talking to, talk to more than one firm, and really make sure that you're getting, you're setting out on the right foot in terms of what the expectations are. For both, the advisor and the client. And both should desire the same thing in terms of having a long-term relationship that's beneficial to most importantly the client. Right. A lot of it comes down to, here's what I want out of you. Can you actually fill what I want? Or are you just telling me what I want to hear? I agree. Yeah, definitely. Do you ever get any like personal questions like your favorite music or sports or stuff like that? I mean, because it seems like people would naturally want to know that stuff if they're going to have a long-term relationship. Definitely. That's the fun part is getting to know people and really getting to mesh with certain people and see, hey, do we even get along? Sometimes you don't get along with somebody. Has nothing to do with finance or numbers or your financial plans and it's like, all right, we just get along and I trust this person. I think trust is a huge thing. Obviously, it seems obvious, but you want to trust whoever you're seeking out as an advisor. So that a lot of times you want to work with someone that you like and respect and trust I think is the big aunt for sure. Yeah, I would need to ask favorite Beatles album. Sorry, I just put them in the chat. No, I'm just kidding. By the way, I think that Dunkin' Worst podcast question ever. Beatles or Stones, right? Oh, because of the obviousness of it, it's like it's not even a contest. Well, it's also like, yes, it's, yes, okay. I'll see the next one. I probably just made a bunch of people mad. Okay. So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because this is a huge, we're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know, six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying. Yeah, like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity cost, right? What are the goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into equity in your home could be used for? Right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want a front load of five to nine plan and you some of this money for that. So that's just one example, but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, hey, I saved up the money. Should I just throw it on to my house? I also think interest. Especially when you're young, borrowing money makes more sense to me because especially with the house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if you realize a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually, right? You still have that cash somewhere. So I think that, that is the kind of thing where it's, it's hard to take that one back if you buy the house and all cash. Obviously, maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding, we're having all cash could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you lose some flexibility by just having it paid off. Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is pretty big, I think. I mean, a couple months ago, you know, it's, it's, like you said, it's more obvious, but still, even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other parts of your life, having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, is, it could be restraining a little bit. But again, you got these people, they just hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know, the conversation's going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation if it's required for the person that we're dealing with. Duncan, I'm not going to make a coach K Duke reference here because I know it's, it's a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize. It's rough. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's been rough. It's a tough way for them to go out. But literally the worst team they could have lost to, you know, everyone knows I guess. Yeah, they had to be tough. All right. Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years now almost and I've never lost power before. So, yeah, glad I could be the one on here today to experience another time. I think Matt was stepping in. We got to mention no portfolio rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami recording a live additional mental spirits that if we figured out, I can hopefully go up on this channel at some point. Keep those questions and comments coming. Remember, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Come. Thanks guys. Thanks for watching and we're back in two weeks. One, one of the things, don't forget we're also available as a podcast wherever you listen to podcasts. So make sure you've subscribed and give us a rating. All that kind of stuff. It helps a lot.

88,88,Episode 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxhrPdZdog,13:25 ,805,0, What happens when the Fed raises rates?," What happens when the Fed raises rates? Okay. So another fed one. What happens when the fed raises rates? Moreover, if the bond market has priced in several rate hikes, why raise rates 25 basis points per month? If 6.25 basis point hikes are priced in this year, what would happen if the fed raised to 1% in March? I don't really understand this one. I have to be honest. Okay. So they're basically saying the fed has this target that they want interest rates to get to, but they're taking their time and it's going to take them a while to get there. And if they're going to get to 2% or 3% anyway, why not just rip that band it off and do it now? So they're taking a stair step function where they're doing like little income instead of time. This is the hardest price, the hardest part of investing is like what's priced into the market? No one really knows because there are no counterfactuals. And I think the idea is like if they ripped the band it off and did this, what would they be signaling? Like, things are worse than people think. There'd be like a meltdown, some countertuitive reaction. Like maybe the bond market would be worse than the stock market in this case. I think it's mostly psychological because people can't handle big, huge changes right away. Throwing the kitchen stick, I think people would just freak out because it's so much of a psychological. Yeah, I can't believe I'm doing this for my phone. Yeah, I know. It's surreal. 45 seconds left on the timer. You have anything else? Yeah. Let's just do the next one. I know we can spend some time in that question. Okay. Hey, so up next, I'm 44 and single with no kids. I have a net worth of around $425,000. College educated and financial controller at a commercial real estate firm in Chicago. I would have more if Twitter had performed better though I didn't sell any. I, or I haven't sold any. I own 55, 5,550 shares at $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am? Okay. So this one was obviously sent to us before Elon Musk decided to happen and buy 9% of Twitter and shares shut up third percent this year. So now this guy's up like 65% on his shares. John throw the chart up of Twitter. This is Twitter since the IPO has not done great. The S&P is up like 200% since Twitter run public. Twitter is up like 15%. That includes this week's run up in prices from Elon Musk taking over. I think it's funny. This guy included Twitter in his asking how he's doing. But because I think if you're a whole financial ecosystem is based around how one stock is doing and it has to make or break you, that's kind of tough. The other thing is you have them in Monwany. The idea of answering where am I? I think that's hard to do because you have to answer where do I want to be, how much you want to spend, when do I want to retire, what are my goals. So Matt, someone comes to you and says, here's how much money I have, here's my age, here's where I want to be. How do you help them understand whether you're on the right track or not? Yeah. Every situation is different. So we really have to take a look at everything that's going on and see where do you want to be. How do you envision the rest of your life playing out and what resources do you currently have to get there and what capabilities do you have to continue to add to these goals and what's prioritized them? So I did a back of the envelope for this one. If this guy did nothing else, that $425,000 or whatever he has, here in 6% of his money, he returns to 65. He's got like $1.3 or $1.4 million. If since he's a listener of the show, he's maxing out his 401k, he's maxing out his Rolf IRA. So that's $26,000 a year call it. If he did that in addition to what he already has, he'd have like $2.3 million. So I think you take that and you say, I don't know what the market is actually going to do, but if I need more than that, I'm going to work longer. I'm going to save more. If I need less than that, maybe it can save less now or retire a little earlier. So I think that's how you look at those goal posts long away. I cheated. I just did that when we finished. I think that was all our lightener on. We did pretty good. We got through seven of them and we helped two questions from Matt. We're going to bring Matt in now before I had my technical piece. Back to the pandemic. Back to the pandemic. There's a storm here today. So yeah, my power went out. But let's do a couple more. We got one floor that we've got from Matt here. And by the way, a lot of these questions, I think are from younger viewers, which I think is great. And a lot of these. So we want to bring Matt in since he specializes working with some younger investors. So let's ask a question here. Okay. So what are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor? Especially as a young person. All right. Really great question. Because I think this is one of the hardest things for people to understand. Like, I don't know because you go to the hospital and they give you a doctor. You don't like to select them. A lot of things. You don't really know what you're looking for. So Matt, why don't you talk about when you're talking to prospective clients? What are the things they should be looking for? And what are some of the red flags that maybe they shouldn't be asking questions about? Yeah, definitely. It's a great question. I think anyone looking for an advisor, you have to be seeking out a long-term relationship. You want something that's going to last. You don't want to hop around a bunch, go from advisor to advisor. So you really want to take it seriously. You want to do your due diligence and you want to ask the right questions. There are wrong questions to ask as well. So right questions being obviously the obvious ones. Are you a fiduciary? Are you going to serve my best interests at all times? If you're a younger investor, I think a key question is, how do I fit into your firm's philosophy, given where I am in life right now? And how is that path going to evolve for me as a client of the firm? And what you're like, as a young person, you could have certain things that are going on in your life and you have life events that change. So it's like, how can you help me along the way as I have these changes happen? Right. So what are the services that I should be seeking out right now that you can provide to me? How will that change? And then what are the fees around those services? Do the fees change? Right. Obviously, you don't want to be paying a ton of money for stuff you don't need. So you want to be cognizant of that as well, I think. So you know, and then we can get into like investment philosophy. If you're someone who is a little bit more experienced when it comes to investing, you've done some on your own, right? Obviously, you want to make the relationship as easy as possible to be able to stick with it for a long time. So you want to make sure philosophy is aligned, I think. Yeah. I also think one of the most important things is like, what does a relationship look like going forward? Like, how are you going to work with me? How often are we going to talk and communicate? Because I know that can vary for our clients. Some people want to have their hand held and talk all the time. Some people want check-ins, you know, irregularly. So it kind of depends like, how are you going to work with me and how are you going to fit with my schedule and personality? Yeah, I think the key is expectations have to be aligned in the beginning. So spend time with whoever you're talking to, talk to more than one firm, and really make sure that you're getting, you're setting out on the right foot in terms of what the expectations are. For both, the advisor and the client. And both should desire the same thing in terms of having a long-term relationship that's beneficial to most importantly the client. Right. A lot of it comes down to, here's what I want out of you. Can you actually fill what I want? Or are you just telling me what I want to hear? I agree. Yeah, definitely. Do you ever get any like personal questions like your favorite music or sports or stuff like that? I mean, because it seems like people would naturally want to know that stuff if they're going to have a long-term relationship. Definitely. That's the fun part is getting to know people and really getting to mesh with certain people and see, hey, do we even get along? Sometimes you don't get along with somebody. Has nothing to do with finance or numbers or your financial plans and it's like, all right, we just get along and I trust this person. I think trust is a huge thing. Obviously, it seems obvious, but you want to trust whoever you're seeking out as an advisor. So that a lot of times you want to work with someone that you like and respect and trust I think is the big aunt for sure. Yeah, I would need to ask favorite Beatles album. Sorry, I just put them in the chat. No, I'm just kidding. By the way, I think that Dunkin' Worst podcast question ever. Beatles or Stones, right? Oh, because of the obviousness of it, it's like it's not even a contest. Well, it's also like, yes, it's, yes, okay. I'll see the next one. I probably just made a bunch of people mad. Okay. So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because this is a huge, we're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know, six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying. Yeah, like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity cost, right? What are the goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into equity in your home could be used for? Right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want a front load of five to nine plan and you some of this money for that. So that's just one example, but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, hey, I saved up the money. Should I just throw it on to my house? I also think interest. Especially when you're young, borrowing money makes more sense to me because especially with the house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if you realize a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually, right? You still have that cash somewhere. So I think that, that is the kind of thing where it's, it's hard to take that one back if you buy the house and all cash. Obviously, maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding, we're having all cash could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you lose some flexibility by just having it paid off. Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is pretty big, I think. I mean, a couple months ago, you know, it's, it's, like you said, it's more obvious, but still, even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other parts of your life, having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, is, it could be restraining a little bit. But again, you got these people, they just hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know, the conversation's going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation if it's required for the person that we're dealing with. Duncan, I'm not going to make a coach K Duke reference here because I know it's, it's a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize. It's rough. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's been rough. It's a tough way for them to go out. But literally the worst team they could have lost to, you know, everyone knows I guess. Yeah, they had to be tough. All right. Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years now almost and I've never lost power before. So, yeah, glad I could be the one on here today to experience another time. I think Matt was stepping in. We got to mention no portfolio rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami recording a live additional mental spirits that if we figured out, I can hopefully go up on this channel at some point.

89,89,Episode 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxhrPdZdog,14:39 ,879,0," I’m 44 and have a net worth of around $425K. Would have more if TWTR didn’t crash, I didn’t sell any   I own 5,550 shares at @ $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am? "," I’m 44 and have a net worth of around $425K. Would have more if TWTR didn’t crash, I didn’t sell any   I own 5,550 shares at @ $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am?  Okay. Hey, so up next, I'm 44 and single with no kids. I have a net worth of around $425,000. College educated and financial controller at a commercial real estate firm in Chicago. I would have more if Twitter had performed better though I didn't sell any. I, or I haven't sold any. I own 55, 5,550 shares at $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am? Okay. So this one was obviously sent to us before Elon Musk decided to happen and buy 9% of Twitter and shares shut up third percent this year. So now this guy's up like 65% on his shares. John throw the chart up of Twitter. This is Twitter since the IPO has not done great. The S&P is up like 200% since Twitter run public. Twitter is up like 15%. That includes this week's run up in prices from Elon Musk taking over. I think it's funny. This guy included Twitter in his asking how he's doing. But because I think if you're a whole financial ecosystem is based around how one stock is doing and it has to make or break you, that's kind of tough. The other thing is you have them in Monwany. The idea of answering where am I? I think that's hard to do because you have to answer where do I want to be, how much you want to spend, when do I want to retire, what are my goals. So Matt, someone comes to you and says, here's how much money I have, here's my age, here's where I want to be. How do you help them understand whether you're on the right track or not? Yeah. Every situation is different. So we really have to take a look at everything that's going on and see where do you want to be. How do you envision the rest of your life playing out and what resources do you currently have to get there and what capabilities do you have to continue to add to these goals and what's prioritized them? So I did a back of the envelope for this one. If this guy did nothing else, that $425,000 or whatever he has, here in 6% of his money, he returns to 65. He's got like $1.3 or $1.4 million. If since he's a listener of the show, he's maxing out his 401k, he's maxing out his Rolf IRA. So that's $26,000 a year call it. If he did that in addition to what he already has, he'd have like $2.3 million. So I think you take that and you say, I don't know what the market is actually going to do, but if I need more than that, I'm going to work longer. I'm going to save more. If I need less than that, maybe it can save less now or retire a little earlier. So I think that's how you look at those goal posts long away. I cheated. I just did that when we finished. I think that was all our lightener on. We did pretty good. We got through seven of them and we helped two questions from Matt. We're going to bring Matt in now before I had my technical piece. Back to the pandemic. Back to the pandemic. There's a storm here today. So yeah, my power went out. But let's do a couple more. We got one floor that we've got from Matt here. And by the way, a lot of these questions, I think are from younger viewers, which I think is great. And a lot of these. So we want to bring Matt in since he specializes working with some younger investors. So let's ask a question here. Okay. So what are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor? Especially as a young person. All right. Really great question. Because I think this is one of the hardest things for people to understand. Like, I don't know because you go to the hospital and they give you a doctor. You don't like to select them. A lot of things. You don't really know what you're looking for. So Matt, why don't you talk about when you're talking to prospective clients? What are the things they should be looking for? And what are some of the red flags that maybe they shouldn't be asking questions about? Yeah, definitely. It's a great question. I think anyone looking for an advisor, you have to be seeking out a long-term relationship. You want something that's going to last. You don't want to hop around a bunch, go from advisor to advisor. So you really want to take it seriously. You want to do your due diligence and you want to ask the right questions. There are wrong questions to ask as well. So right questions being obviously the obvious ones. Are you a fiduciary? Are you going to serve my best interests at all times? If you're a younger investor, I think a key question is, how do I fit into your firm's philosophy, given where I am in life right now? And how is that path going to evolve for me as a client of the firm? And what you're like, as a young person, you could have certain things that are going on in your life and you have life events that change. So it's like, how can you help me along the way as I have these changes happen? Right. So what are the services that I should be seeking out right now that you can provide to me? How will that change? And then what are the fees around those services? Do the fees change? Right. Obviously, you don't want to be paying a ton of money for stuff you don't need. So you want to be cognizant of that as well, I think. So you know, and then we can get into like investment philosophy. If you're someone who is a little bit more experienced when it comes to investing, you've done some on your own, right? Obviously, you want to make the relationship as easy as possible to be able to stick with it for a long time. So you want to make sure philosophy is aligned, I think. Yeah. I also think one of the most important things is like, what does a relationship look like going forward? Like, how are you going to work with me? How often are we going to talk and communicate? Because I know that can vary for our clients. Some people want to have their hand held and talk all the time. Some people want check-ins, you know, irregularly. So it kind of depends like, how are you going to work with me and how are you going to fit with my schedule and personality? Yeah, I think the key is expectations have to be aligned in the beginning. So spend time with whoever you're talking to, talk to more than one firm, and really make sure that you're getting, you're setting out on the right foot in terms of what the expectations are. For both, the advisor and the client. And both should desire the same thing in terms of having a long-term relationship that's beneficial to most importantly the client. Right. A lot of it comes down to, here's what I want out of you. Can you actually fill what I want? Or are you just telling me what I want to hear? I agree. Yeah, definitely. Do you ever get any like personal questions like your favorite music or sports or stuff like that? I mean, because it seems like people would naturally want to know that stuff if they're going to have a long-term relationship. Definitely. That's the fun part is getting to know people and really getting to mesh with certain people and see, hey, do we even get along? Sometimes you don't get along with somebody. Has nothing to do with finance or numbers or your financial plans and it's like, all right, we just get along and I trust this person. I think trust is a huge thing. Obviously, it seems obvious, but you want to trust whoever you're seeking out as an advisor. So that a lot of times you want to work with someone that you like and respect and trust I think is the big aunt for sure. Yeah, I would need to ask favorite Beatles album. Sorry, I just put them in the chat. No, I'm just kidding. By the way, I think that Dunkin' Worst podcast question ever. Beatles or Stones, right? Oh, because of the obviousness of it, it's like it's not even a contest. Well, it's also like, yes, it's, yes, okay. I'll see the next one. I probably just made a bunch of people mad. Okay. So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because this is a huge, we're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know, six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying. Yeah, like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity cost, right? What are the goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into equity in your home could be used for? Right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want a front load of five to nine plan and you some of this money for that. So that's just one example, but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, hey, I saved up the money. Should I just throw it on to my house? I also think interest. Especially when you're young, borrowing money makes more sense to me because especially with the house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if you realize a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually, right? You still have that cash somewhere. So I think that, that is the kind of thing where it's, it's hard to take that one back if you buy the house and all cash. Obviously, maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding, we're having all cash could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you lose some flexibility by just having it paid off. Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is pretty big, I think. I mean, a couple months ago, you know, it's, it's, like you said, it's more obvious, but still, even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other parts of your life, having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, is, it could be restraining a little bit. But again, you got these people, they just hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know, the conversation's going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation if it's required for the person that we're dealing with. Duncan, I'm not going to make a coach K Duke reference here because I know it's, it's a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize. It's rough. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's been rough. It's a tough way for them to go out. But literally the worst team they could have lost to, you know, everyone knows I guess. Yeah, they had to be tough. All right. Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years now almost and I've never lost power before. So, yeah, glad I could be the one on here today to experience another time. I think Matt was stepping in. We got to mention no portfolio rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami recording a live additional mental spirits that if we figured out, I can hopefully go up on this channel at some point.

90,90,Episode 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxhrPdZdog,17:19 ,1039,0," What are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor, especially as a young person?"," What are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor, especially as a young person? And by the way, a lot of these questions, I think are from younger viewers, which I think is great. And a lot of these. So we want to bring Matt in since he specializes working with some younger investors. So let's ask a question here. Okay. So what are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor? Especially as a young person. All right. Really great question. Because I think this is one of the hardest things for people to understand. Like, I don't know because you go to the hospital and they give you a doctor. You don't like to select them. A lot of things. You don't really know what you're looking for. So Matt, why don't you talk about when you're talking to prospective clients? What are the things they should be looking for? And what are some of the red flags that maybe they shouldn't be asking questions about? Yeah, definitely. It's a great question. I think anyone looking for an advisor, you have to be seeking out a long-term relationship. You want something that's going to last. You don't want to hop around a bunch, go from advisor to advisor. So you really want to take it seriously. You want to do your due diligence and you want to ask the right questions. There are wrong questions to ask as well. So right questions being obviously the obvious ones. Are you a fiduciary? Are you going to serve my best interests at all times? If you're a younger investor, I think a key question is, how do I fit into your firm's philosophy, given where I am in life right now? And how is that path going to evolve for me as a client of the firm? And what you're like, as a young person, you could have certain things that are going on in your life and you have life events that change. So it's like, how can you help me along the way as I have these changes happen? Right. So what are the services that I should be seeking out right now that you can provide to me? How will that change? And then what are the fees around those services? Do the fees change? Right. Obviously, you don't want to be paying a ton of money for stuff you don't need. So you want to be cognizant of that as well, I think. So you know, and then we can get into like investment philosophy. If you're someone who is a little bit more experienced when it comes to investing, you've done some on your own, right? Obviously, you want to make the relationship as easy as possible to be able to stick with it for a long time. So you want to make sure philosophy is aligned, I think. Yeah. I also think one of the most important things is like, what does a relationship look like going forward? Like, how are you going to work with me? How often are we going to talk and communicate? Because I know that can vary for our clients. Some people want to have their hand held and talk all the time. Some people want check-ins, you know, irregularly. So it kind of depends like, how are you going to work with me and how are you going to fit with my schedule and personality? Yeah, I think the key is expectations have to be aligned in the beginning. So spend time with whoever you're talking to, talk to more than one firm, and really make sure that you're getting, you're setting out on the right foot in terms of what the expectations are. For both, the advisor and the client. And both should desire the same thing in terms of having a long-term relationship that's beneficial to most importantly the client. Right. A lot of it comes down to, here's what I want out of you. Can you actually fill what I want? Or are you just telling me what I want to hear? I agree. Yeah, definitely. Do you ever get any like personal questions like your favorite music or sports or stuff like that? I mean, because it seems like people would naturally want to know that stuff if they're going to have a long-term relationship. Definitely. That's the fun part is getting to know people and really getting to mesh with certain people and see, hey, do we even get along? Sometimes you don't get along with somebody. Has nothing to do with finance or numbers or your financial plans and it's like, all right, we just get along and I trust this person. I think trust is a huge thing. Obviously, it seems obvious, but you want to trust whoever you're seeking out as an advisor. So that a lot of times you want to work with someone that you like and respect and trust I think is the big aunt for sure. Yeah, I would need to ask favorite Beatles album. Sorry, I just put them in the chat. No, I'm just kidding. By the way, I think that Dunkin' Worst podcast question ever. Beatles or Stones, right? Oh, because of the obviousness of it, it's like it's not even a contest. Well, it's also like, yes, it's, yes, okay. I'll see the next one. I probably just made a bunch of people mad. Okay. So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because this is a huge, we're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know, six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying. Yeah, like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity cost, right? What are the goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into equity in your home could be used for? Right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want a front load of five to nine plan and you some of this money for that. So that's just one example, but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, hey, I saved up the money. Should I just throw it on to my house? I also think interest. Especially when you're young, borrowing money makes more sense to me because especially with the house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if you realize a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually, right? You still have that cash somewhere. So I think that, that is the kind of thing where it's, it's hard to take that one back if you buy the house and all cash. Obviously, maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding, we're having all cash could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you lose some flexibility by just having it paid off. Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is pretty big, I think. I mean, a couple months ago, you know, it's, it's, like you said, it's more obvious, but still, even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other parts of your life, having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, is, it could be restraining a little bit. But again, you got these people, they just hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know, the conversation's going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation if it's required for the person that we're dealing with. Duncan, I'm not going to make a coach K Duke reference here because I know it's, it's a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize. It's rough. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's been rough. It's a tough way for them to go out. But literally the worst team they could have lost to, you know, everyone knows I guess. Yeah, they had to be tough. All right. Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years now almost and I've never lost power before. So, yeah, glad I could be the one on here today to experience another time. I think Matt was stepping in. We got to mention no portfolio rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami recording a live additional mental spirits that if we figured out, I can hopefully go up on this channel at some point.

So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because this is a huge, we're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know, six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying. Yeah, like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity cost, right? What are the goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into equity in your home could be used for? Right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want a front load of five to nine plan and you some of this money for that. So that's just one example, but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, hey, I saved up the money. Should I just throw it on to my house? I also think interest. Especially when you're young, borrowing money makes more sense to me because especially with the house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if you realize a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually, right? You still have that cash somewhere. So I think that, that is the kind of thing where it's, it's hard to take that one back if you buy the house and all cash. Obviously, maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding, we're having all cash could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you lose some flexibility by just having it paid off. Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is pretty big, I think. I mean, a couple months ago, you know, it's, it's, like you said, it's more obvious, but still, even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other parts of your life, having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, is, it could be restraining a little bit. But again, you got these people, they just hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know, the conversation's going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation if it's required for the person that we're dealing with. Duncan, I'm not going to make a coach K Duke reference here because I know it's, it's a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize. It's rough. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's been rough. It's a tough way for them to go out. But literally the worst team they could have lost to, you know, everyone knows I guess. Yeah, they had to be tough. All right. Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years now almost and I've never lost power before. So, yeah, glad I could be the one on here today to experience another time. I think Matt was stepping in. We got to mention no portfolio rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami recording a live additional mental spirits that if we figured out, I can hopefully go up on this channel at some point. Keep those questions and comments coming. Remember, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Come. Thanks guys. Thanks for watching and we're back in two weeks. One, one of the things, don't forget we're also available as a podcast wherever you listen to podcasts. So make sure you've subscribed and give us a rating. All that kind of stuff. It helps a lot. So yeah, thanks. We have a fancy new cover with Duncan and I on it. Our pictures. It looks amazing. It's feel famous. All right. Thanks everyone for watching. See you.","[-0.013766204006969929, -0.011780322529375553, 0.02652982622385025, -0.03125995025038719, -0.002422903198748827, 0.007538635283708572, 0.0016725744353607297, -0.024473251774907112,
