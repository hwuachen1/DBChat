Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",f7e0ed44-3170-4d6e-8b56-0ef3ab268167

And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",9c4bf3fd-a9a4-411c-b7fe-d86373855b2e
3,Episode 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg,01:04 ,64,0, Saving vs. Investing," Saving vs. Investing very detailed information with us. How much money they make, how much they have saved, what kind of stock options they have at work, their retirement plan, their investment strategies, the financial problems they're having, all this kind of stuff. We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local.

That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",1eabc0b9-f7be-4f9a-be1a-34a68a847db2
5,Episode 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg,09:26 ,566,0, What is your opinion on interest only mortgages?," What is your opinion on interest only mortgages? And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are.

How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",a87975e1-c23c-430c-98df-64c868bd4e39

And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea.

When does it make sense to sell your house and just start renting?," I have a lot of equity in my house. When does it make sense to sell your house and just start renting? We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",26f9a8e5-a309-4250-a26d-1a9ea1ab60cc

Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

How do I avoid regret not buying nice things?," I'm saving a large percentage of my income so that I can retire early. How do I avoid regret not buying nice things? I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house.

Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless.

15,Episode 5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco,01:12 ,72,0, How do we diversify our portfolio to provide more dividend income in a tax efficient way?," How do we diversify our portfolio to provide more dividend income in a tax efficient way? all this kind of stuff. We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game.

So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff.

Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",76f035d9-f476-4092-8cb6-a4a0dcab825f

Is 70 too many?  I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what?

23,Episode 7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJVGn_wFc24,00:58 ,58,0, How should I invest a lifetime pension?," How should I invest a lifetime pension? they make us think, sometimes they help us learn. One of the really cool parts is that people place their trust in us and they share these very detailed information with us. How much money they make, how much they have saved, what kind of stock options they have at work, their retirement plan, their investment strategies, the financial problems they're having, all this kind of stuff. We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too.

The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

24,Episode 7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJVGn_wFc24,05:12 ,312,0, What are your thoughts on using an SBLOC (Security Based Line of Credit) against a brokerage account to borrow for a primary residence of a rental property?," What are your thoughts on using an SBLOC (Security Based Line of Credit) against a brokerage account to borrow for a primary residence of a rental property? to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",ce18bc8c-643f-4f90-be07-b4c634b99ac4
28,Episode 8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7p1SmPuoBg,04:37 ,277,0, How should I invest my parents' cash?," How should I invest my parents' cash? from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better.

The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

31,Episode 9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0,00:45 ,45,0, Could cryptocurrency supply hurt performance of the S&P 500?," Could cryptocurrency supply hurt performance of the S&P 500? There's really no handbooks for this stuff when it comes to your finances, so each week or inbox is a full of questions from people who listen to our podcast or watch these videos or read our blogs. Sometimes these emails from people make us laugh, sometimes they make us cringe, sometimes they make us think, sometimes they help us learn. One of the really cool parts is that people place their trust in us and they share these very detailed information with us. How much money they make, how much they have saved, what kind of stock options they have at work, their retirement plan, their investment strategies, the financial problems they're having, all this kind of stuff. We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear.

32,Episode 9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0,08:17 ,497,0, Should I sell my Magic the Gathering collection and invest the cash?," Should I sell my Magic the Gathering collection and invest the cash? One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying.

And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

36,Episode 10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Z6xtJri6E,07:32 ,452,0, Leasing a car.," Leasing a car. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one.

Sometimes these emails from people make us laugh, sometimes they make us cringe, sometimes they make us think, sometimes they help us learn. One of the really cool parts is that people place their trust in us and they share these very detailed information with us. How much money they make, how much they have saved, what kind of stock options they have at work, their retirement plan, their investment strategies, the financial problems they're having, all this kind of stuff. We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless.

Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown.

And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem?

Sometimes these emails from people make us laugh, sometimes they make us cringe, sometimes they make us think, sometimes they help us learn. One of the really cool parts is that people place their trust in us and they share these very detailed information with us. How much money they make, how much they have saved, what kind of stock options they have at work, their retirement plan, their investment strategies, the financial problems they're having, all this kind of stuff. We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right.

I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear.

There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",de5d6286-581f-4218-a606-c13d37ca8db4
52,Episode 14,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDdqgarzEDw,06:50 ,410,0, Is buying a rental property with my 401k a bad idea? ," Is buying a rental property with my 401k a bad idea?  All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here.

55,Episode 15,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gsImCPmeE,02:19 ,139,0, Stablecoins," Stablecoins stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless.

So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

59,Episode 16,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOZAWqLiIUs,03:10 ,190,0, Market sell off ," Market sell off  had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too.

Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem?

There's really no handbooks for this stuff when it comes to your finances, so each week or inbox is a full of questions from people who listen to our podcast or watch these videos or read our blogs. Sometimes these emails from people make us laugh, sometimes they make us cringe, sometimes they make us think, sometimes they help us learn. One of the really cool parts is that people place their trust in us and they share these very detailed information with us. How much money they make, how much they have saved, what kind of stock options they have at work, their retirement plan, their investment strategies, the financial problems they're having, all this kind of stuff. We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

67,Episode 18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt2gdPVckHg,02:16 ,136,0, Inflation and gas prices during a recession.," Inflation and gas prices during a recession. a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

68,Episode 18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt2gdPVckHg,07:02 ,422,0, Profits during this year's massive selloff and where is the money going?," Profits during this year's massive selloff and where is the money going? I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic.

71,Episode 19,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ol78hO6Is,03:42 ,222,0, Preparing for the recession.," Preparing for the recession. too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Any actionable ideas? I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day.

Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown.

And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water.

So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

85,Episode 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxhrPdZdog,05:16 ,316,0, What will bring more value in the long run for a child?," What will bring more value in the long run for a child? It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price.

Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem?

92,Episode 23,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm86Kqi8LHk,02:58 ,178,0, What is the best way to start investing in bonds?," What is the best way to start investing in bonds? Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently.

That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are.

That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals.

I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

102,Episode 25,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6aGivL8SPM,06:25 ,385,0, Long term time horizon and buying slowly into innovation names.," Long term time horizon and buying slowly into innovation names. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here.

Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do.

106,Episode 26,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U,02:48 ,168,0, Individual Stocks," Individual Stocks the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera.

He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",ba164d6e-b4d2-45cc-a418-a9e8a66901ce

He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right.

Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water.

We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what?

Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

116,Episode 28,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck3UVRHqEHE,02:58 ,178,0,  Are ETF's/Index Funds safer compared to individual stocks?,"  Are ETF's/Index Funds safer compared to individual stocks? Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff.

Can we finally put the argument to bed and call it a myth?  and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic.

This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one.

Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear.

And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day.

126,Episode 30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw,02:28 ,148,0, Do you have any tips on writing? ," Do you have any tips on writing?  I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear.

We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job.

Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

141,Episode 33,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc,04:43 ,283,0, Paying down debt.," Paying down debt. book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here.

Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem?

Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day.

Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here.

So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear.

He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying.

And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

178,Episode 40,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmuRSF5ULbY,03:08 ,188,0, Investing a lump sum.," Investing a lump sum. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless.

Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

184,Episode 41,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZBCrXCAfi0,02:57 ,177,0, Inflation linked bonds.," Inflation linked bonds. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are.

Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution.

We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful.

And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are.

That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year.

A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

206,Episode 45,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs,04:44 ,284,0, Leasing vs Buying," Leasing vs Buying book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless.

It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept.

So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",3c8627f1-4951-447a-9fd9-082832983155

So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

218,Episode 47,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FkMUZPLtzw,07:15 ,435,0," I'm new to finance, what do I do with this $400k?"," I'm new to finance, what do I do with this $400k? limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are.

223,Episode 48,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE,04:55 ,295,0, The worst case for the stock market," The worst case for the stock market Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation?

So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff.

Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what?

Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

248,Episode 53,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w,03:59 ,239,0," As a young person, should I buy some bonds or buy beaten down stocks?"," As a young person, should I buy some bonds or buy beaten down stocks? So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market.

Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable.

And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local.

And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday.

So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here.

And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",8163728d-d9a4-43f6-9aab-1f9ffadae8e4
254,Episode 54,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNYXVFuqzks,08:56 ,536,0, The wealth effect," The wealth effect If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation?

If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction.

That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

260,Episode 55,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04,07:34 ,454,0, T bills vs. Savings Account?," T bills vs. Savings Account? here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy.

264,Episode 56,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPpKb2tcqpI,02:25 ,145,0, What to do with extra cash.," What to do with extra cash. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.",a7e5be0b-046c-4a13-9106-ac7497b20dde

Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right.

The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process.

That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear.

We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday.

The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown.

And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

288,Episode 60,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9HiRf26H4I,03:35 ,215,0, Why own bonds?," Why own bonds? of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday.

Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

293,Episode 61,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYQAYc26bm0,02:56 ,176,0, Adding bonds to a 100% stock portfolio," Adding bonds to a 100% stock portfolio Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house.

295,Episode 61,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYQAYc26bm0,11:10 ,670,0, Can the stock market grow forever?," Can the stock market grow forever? best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do.

298,Episode 62,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTFpiOAWv7k,01:05 ,65,0, How retirees should protect their portfolio. ," How retirees should protect their portfolio.  very detailed information with us. How much money they make, how much they have saved, what kind of stock options they have at work, their retirement plan, their investment strategies, the financial problems they're having, all this kind of stuff. We've come to realize, hey, wait a minute, maybe these questions would be useful beyond our inboxes. Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make.

Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

304,Episode 63,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE,09:03 ,543,0, How to invest in bonds.," How to invest in bonds. He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day.

But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction.

Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear.

309,Episode 64,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M,06:21 ,381,0, Covered Call ETFs vs Bond ETFs.," Covered Call ETFs vs Bond ETFs. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today.

A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got?

And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

Because you can look at these questions and go, wait, how would I handle that situation? Or I've dealt with something like that. Did I do the right thing? Or what if something like this happens to me? Or what is this person thinking? How could they be so stupid? So, we don't pretend to have all the answers here. As with most things in life, there's a lot of gray area here. There's no right or wrong answers when it comes to a lot of things with your finances. And I want to get this out of the way too, that this show is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment decisions, as we have to say, and the legalese. We've been doing this long enough where we hope we can provide some context, some perspective, and some opinions based on our experience. We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come into play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now, real quick on some of the form out of the show before we get started here, we get a wide range of questions, everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto to saving retirement, everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing a podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here, just laying it out there in my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey, everyone. We see you in the chat here. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown.

319,Episode 66,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeKIvYWjU,08:42 ,522,0, Should you hold leveraged ETFs in a Roth IRA.," Should you hold leveraged ETFs in a Roth IRA. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do.

323,Episode 67,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh7XLSLCpKQ,03:00 ,180,0, Did VCs cause the bank run on Twitter?," Did VCs cause the bank run on Twitter? Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it at all. So it's cool to see so many of you already showing up there. Okay. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk, serve the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written. It is written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. Like to this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Global wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, and it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. This 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more of in the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through the available more detail that we'll get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. I'm not going to put those to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowell's Management Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single male is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction.

That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are.

You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it and you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. One more bonus question for you guys that I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasp in. Oh, yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house as they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. I was just going to get a little bit of a ride. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. It's, you know, they like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of, like, long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? I pay it in full and just stop my feet. I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I, do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go eye for eye. You throw a tooth. You throw a crown. You throw a crown. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. And see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal. And then you can sell them as one bird. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone, even from the haters who call me new leaders. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

324,Episode 67,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh7XLSLCpKQ,08:44 ,524,0, What happens if a brokerage fails?," What happens if a brokerage fails? And the idea there is that do yourself a future self of favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, gross to 12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to 24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past ednauseum called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, however, oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. So this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by possibly. Yep, this was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools 401k, Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate and also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every all the time, right? Those are pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is there are now huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. You're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this I think soberly, Ben I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. But the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on let's say 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. Taxes are a serious thing. Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough and that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday.
